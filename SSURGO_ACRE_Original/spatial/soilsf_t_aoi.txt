"IN157"|4|"ERO"|"Severely eroded spot"|An area where on the average 75 percent or more of the original surface layer has been lost because of accelerated erosion. Not used in map units that are named severely eroded, very severely eroded, or gullied. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251536"
"IN157"|4|"ESB"|"Escarpment, bedrock"|A relatively continuous and steep slope or cliff, which generally is produced by erosion but can be produced by faulting, that breaks the general continuity of more gently sloping land surfaces. Exposed earthy material is hard or soft bedrock.|"251537"
"IN157"|4|"GPI"|"Gravel pit"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and used, without crushing, as a source of sand or gravel. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251538"
"IN157"|4|"GRA"|"Gravelly spot"|A spot where the surface layer has more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments that are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter in an area that has less than 15 percent rock fragments. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251539"
"IN157"|4|"MAR"|"Marsh or swamp"|A water saturated, very poorly drained area that is intermittently or permanently covered by water. Sedges, cattails, and rushes are the dominate vegetation in marshes, and trees or shrubs are the dominant vegetation in swamps. Not used in map units where the named soils are poorly drained or very poorly drained. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251540"
"IN157"|4|"MPI"|"Mine or quarry"|An open excavation from which soil and underlying material have been removed and in which bedrock is exposed. Also denotes surface openings to underground mines. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251541"
"IN157"|4|"MUC"|"Muck spot"|An area within a poorly drained or very poorly drained soil that has a histic epipedon or where the surface is organic. The spot symbol is used only in map units consisting of mineral soil. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251542"
"IN157"|4|"OVW"|"Overwash spot"|An area with overwash 10 to 40 inches thick over the original surface. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251543"
"IN157"|4|"SAN"|"Sandy spot"|A spot where the surface layer is loamy fine sand or coarser in areas where the surface layer of the named soils in the surrounding map unit is very fine sandy loam or finer. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251544"
"IN157"|4|"SBR"|"Shale bedrock at 20 to 40 inches"|An area underlain with shale bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251545"
"IN157"|4|"SLP"|"Short, steep slope"|A narrow area of soil having slopes that are at least two slope classes steeper than the slope class of the surrounding map unit.|"251546"
"IN157"|4|"SSR"|"Siltstone bedrock at 40 to 60 inches"|An area underlain with siltstone bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251547"
"IN157"|4|"UWT"|"Unclassified water"|Small, natural or man-made lake, pond, or pit that contains water, of an unspecified nature, most of the year. Typically .2 to 2 acres.|"251548"
