National has added no new interpretations in 2022.  Many soil interpretations that were optional were made mandatory but Indiana was already uploading them so there will be no change there.  The following map units were updated for Fiscal Year 2022.  No map units were updated in this county. The State of Indiana has added all minor components to the export.  This has cause a condition where some minors are completely populated, some are partially populated and others are populated only at the component level as placeholders and to help populate the hydric soils lists.  These latter components do not have any horizon data associated with them.  There is no good way to separate the fully from the partially populated.  Based on this the minor components for all units will be listed as ""Not Certified"" unless all minor components in the county are fully populated. "|"11498"|"78903"|"78805"
