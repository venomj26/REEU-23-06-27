The yields are based mainly on the experience and records of farmers, conservationists, and extension agents. Available yield data from nearby areas and results of field trials and demonstrations also are considered.

The management needed to obtain the indicated yields of the various crops depends on the kind of soil and the crop. Management can include drainage, erosion control, and protection from flooding; the proper planting and seeding rates; suitable high-yielding crop varieties; appropriate and timely tillage; control of weeds, plant diseases, and harmful insects; favorable soil reaction and optimum levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and trace elements for each crop; effective use of crop residue, barnyard manure, and green manure crops; and harvesting that ensures the smallest possible loss.

Units are cubic feet per acre per year. This is called the ""culmination of mean annual increment"" (CMAI).

Mean annual increment (MAI) is the average yearly wood volume growth per acre of a stand. This is computed by dividing the total wood volume by the stand age. As the stand increases in age, the MAI also increases until tree-to-tree competition and physiological maturity reduce the rate of increase. The point when a stand reaches its maximum MAI is called the ""culmination of mean annual increment"" (CMAI).

Black Walnut Suitability Index ratings provide a method of rating Missouri soils based on their potential or suitability for black walnut growth.
  
The values for soil factors in the index are added together and then multiplied by critical factors to produce the final rating. Only factors listed under ""rating reasons"" are those adversely affecting the overall rating. 

The calculated black walnut rating factor ranges from 0 to 1 with the higher values indicating better suitability. On the basis of these numeric values, the soils are grouped into suitability classes. These classes are identified as ""unsuited,"" ""poorly suited,"" ""somewhat suited,"" ""moderately suited,"" ""well suited,"" and ""very well suited.""

The best suited soils for black walnut growth are very deep, moderately well drained or well drained, medium textured, slightly acid to slightly alkaline, have a high available water capacity, no rock fragments in the upper 24 inches, and are subject to brief or very brief flooding duration. Soils that are unsuited have a shallow effective rooting depth, a high water table (poor drainage), a low available water capacity, or are subject to flooding of very long duration.

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen, which is displayed on the report.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.

Corn suitability ratings (CSR2) provide a relative ranking of all soils mapped in the State of Iowa according to their potential for the intensive production of row crops. The CSR2 is an index that can be used to rate the potential yield of one soil against that of another over a period of time. Considered in the ratings are average weather conditions and frequency of use of the soil for row crops. Ratings range from 100 for soils that have no physical limitations, occur on minimal slopes, and can be continuously row cropped to as low as 5 for soils that are severely limited for the production of row crops.

2660|"Minnesota Crop Productivity Index"|"mutext"|"text"|"Narrative Text"|||"The Minnesota Crop Productivity Index (CPI) ratings provide a relative ranking of soils based on their potential for intensive row crop production.  An index can be used to rate the potential yield of one soil against that of another over a period of time.  Ratings range from 0 to 100.  The higher numbers indicate higher production potential.

The CPI ratings do not take into account climatic factors, such as the differences in precipitation or growing degree days across Minnesota.  The ratings are based on physical and chemical properties of the soils and on such hazards and flooding and ponding.  Available water capacity, reaction (pH), slopes, soil moisture status, cation-exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter content, salinity, and surface fragments are the major properties evaluated when CPI ratings are generated.  The soil properties selected are those that are important for the production of corn.

All map units in Minnesota were initially evaluated using the Cropland Productivity rule in the National Soil Information System (NASIS).  They were assigned a value using an overall CPI based on the combined properties and characteristics of the map unit as a whole, and the values were adjusted based on tacit knowledge of local experts.  An individual map unit (for example, Canisteo clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes) will have the same CPI value wherever that map unit occurs throughout the state.

When the soils are rated, the following assumptions are made:  a) adequate management, b) no irrigation, c) artificial drainage where required, d) no land leveling or terracing, and e) no climatic factors considered. 

The map unit CPI was used to update the map unit crop yields for corn and soybeans.  Even through predicted average yields will change with time, the productivity indices are expected to remain relatively constant in relation to one another over time."|||"Property"||||0|0|0|0||0|||-1|"MNCPI"|"textcat='CropProd'"|||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|4||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""4"">

""Risk of corrosion"" pertains to potential soil-induced electrochemical or chemical action that corrodes or weakens uncoated steel. The rate of corrosion of uncoated steel is related to such factors as soil moisture, particle-size distribution, acidity, and electrical conductivity of the soil. Special site examination and design may be needed if the combination of factors results in a severe hazard of corrosion. The steel in installations that intersect soil boundaries or soil layers is more susceptible to corrosion than the steel in installations that are entirely within one kind of soil or within one soil layer.

This interpretation rates soils for their use in establishing and maintaining turf for lawns and golf fairways and ornamental trees and shrubs for residential or commercial landscaping. Lawns and landscaping require soils on which turf and ornamental trees and shrubs can be established and maintained. Golf fairways are subject to heavy foot traffic and some light vehicular traffic. Cutting or filling may be required. 

The ratings are based on the use of soil material at the site, which may have been altered by some land smoothing. Irrigation may or may not be needed and is not a criterion in rating. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth and trafficability after vegetation is established. The properties that affect plant growth are reaction; depth to a water table; ponding; depth to bedrock or a cemented pan; the available water capacity in the upper 40 inches; the content of salts, sodium, or calcium carbonate; and sulfidic materials. The properties that affect trafficability are flooding, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, stoniness, and the amount of sand, clay, or organic matter in the surface layer. The suitability of the soil for traps, tees, roughs, and greens is not considered in the ratings.

Not considered in the ratings, but important in evaluating a site, are the location and accessibility of the area, the size and shape of the area and its scenic quality, vegetation, access to water, potential water impoundment sites, and access to public sewer lines. Soils that are subject to flooding are limited by the duration and intensity of flooding and the season when flooding occurs. In planning for lawns, landscaping, or golf fairways, onsite assessment of the height, duration, intensity, and frequency of flooding is essential.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.  

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit.  The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site.

""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

Unpaved local roads and streets are those roads and streets that carry traffic year round but have a graded surface of local soil material or aggregate. 
Description:

Unpaved local roads and streets are those roads and streets that carry traffic year round but have a graded surface of local soil material or aggregate. 
The roads and streets consist of
(1) the underlying local soil material, either cut or fill, which is called ""the sub-grade"";
(2) the surface, which may be the same as the subgrade or may have aggrate such as crushed limestone added.

They are graded to shed water, and conventional drainage measures are provided.  These roads and streets are built mainly from the soil at the site. Soil interpretations for local roads and streets are used as a tool in evaluating soil suitability and identifying soil limitations for the practice.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use. Soil properties and qualities that affect local roads and streets are those that influence the ease of excavation and grading and the traffic-supporting capacity.  The properties and qualities that affect the ease of excavation and grading are hardness of bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, flooding, the amount of large stones, and slope.  The properties that affect traffic-supporting capacity are soil strength as inferred from the AASHTO group index and the Unified classification, subsidence, shrink-swell behavior, potential frost action, and depth to the seasonal high water table.  The dust generating tendacy of the soil is also considered."|||"Interpretation"|"ENG - Unpaved Local Roads and Streets"|1||0|1|0|0||0|||1|"Unpaved"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|5||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""5"">

Ground-based Solar Arrays, Ballast Anchor Systems

Ground-based solar arrays are sets of photovoltaic panels that are not situated on a building or pole.  These installations consist of a racking system that holds the panel in the desired orientation and the foundation structures that hold the racking system to the ground.  Two basic methods are used to hold the systems to the ground, based on site conditions and cost.  One method employs driven piles, screw augers, or concrete piers that penetrate into the soil to provide a stable foundation. The ease of installation and general site suitability of soil-penetrating anchoring systems depends on soil characteristics such as rock fragment content, soil depth, soil strength, soil corrosivity, shrink-swell tendencies, and drainage.  The other basic anchoring system utilizes precast ballasted footings or ballasted trays on the soil surface to make the arrays too heavy to move.  The site considerations that impact both basic systems are slope, slope aspect, wind speed, land surface shape, flooding, and ponding.  Other factors that will contribute to the function of a solar power array include daily hours of sunlight and shading from hills, trees, or buildings.

Ballast anchor systems can be used in some places where soil-penetrating systems cannot, such as in shallow or stony soil.  Also, since they do not penetrate the soil, ballast systems can be used where the soil is contaminated and disturbance is to be avoided.  The soil in the area must have sufficient strength to be able to support the vehicles that haul the ballast and the machinery to install it.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Ground-based Solar Panel Arrays"".  If a soil's property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership indices greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Ground-based Solar Panel Arrays"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices.  These are not limited (rating index = 0), somewhat limited (rating index greater than 0 and less than 1.0), or very limited (rating index = 1.0).


Numerical ratings indicate the degree of limitation. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil has the least similarity to a good site (1.0) and the point at which the soil feature is very much like known good sites (0).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.

Sand is a natural aggregate (0.05 millimeter to 2 millimeters in diameter) suitable for commercial use with a minimum of processing. It is used in many kinds of construction. Specifications for each use vary widely. Only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity is evaluated. The suitability of the material for specific purposes is not evaluated, nor are factors that affect excavation of the material.

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a source of sand are gradation of grain sizes (as indicated by the Unified classification of the soil), the thickness of suitable material, and the content of rock fragments. If the bottom layer of the soil contains sand, the soil is considered a likely source regardless of thickness. The assumption is that the sand layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness. The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 6 feet.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of sand. A rating of ""good"" or ""fair"" means that sand is likely to be in or below the soil. The bottom layer and the thickest layer of the soil are assigned numerical ratings. These ratings indicate the likelihood that the layer is a source of sand. The number 0.00 indicates that the layer is a ""poor source."" The number 1.00 indicates that the layer is a ""good source.""

Topsoil is used to cover an area so that vegetation can be established and maintained. The surface layer of most soils is generally preferred for topsoil because of its content of organic matter. Organic matter greatly increases the absorption and retention of moisture and nutrients for plant growth.

The upper 40 inches of a soil is evaluated for use as topsoil. Also evaluated is the reclamation potential of the borrow area. Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of topsoil. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect plant growth; the ease of excavating, loading, and spreading the material; and reclamation of the borrow area. Toxic substances, soil reaction, and the properties that are inferred from soil texture, such as available water capacity and fertility, affect plant growth. The ease of excavating, loading, and spreading is affected by rock fragments, slope, depth to a water table, soil texture, and thickness of suitable material. Reclamation of the borrow area is affected by slope, depth to a water table, rock fragments, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and toxic material.

Numerical ratings between 0.00 and 0.99 are given after the specified features. These numbers indicate the degree to which the features limit the soils as sources of topsoil. The lower the number, the greater the limitation.

Reclamation material is used in areas that have been drastically disturbed by surface mining or similar activities. When these areas are reclaimed, layers of soil material or unconsolidated geological material, or both, are replaced in a vertical sequence. The reconstructed soil favors plant growth. The ratings do not apply to quarries or other mined areas that require an offsite source of reconstruction material. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect erosion and stability of the surface and the productive potential of the reclaimed soil. These properties include the content of sodium, salts, and calcium carbonate; reaction; available water capacity; erodibility; texture; content of rock fragments; and content of organic matter and other features that affect fertility.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of reclamation material. The ratings are based on the amount of suitable material and on soil properties that affect the ease of excavation and the performance of the material after it is in place. The thickness of the suitable material is a major consideration. The ease of excavation is affected by large stones, depth to a water table, and slope. How well the soil performs in place after it has been compacted and drained is determined by its strength (as inferred from the AASHTO classification of the soil) and linear extensibility (shrink-swell potential). Normal compaction, minor processing, and other standard construction practices are assumed.

When the material is properly used in reclamation, a rating of ""good"" means that establishing and maintaining vegetation are relatively easy, that the surface is stable and resists erosion, and that the reclaimed soil has good potential productivity. A rating of ""fair"" means that vegetation can be established and maintained and the soil can be stabilized through modification of one or more properties. For satisfactory performance, it may be necessary to topdress with better suited material or add soil amendments. A rating of ""poor"" means that revegetation and stabilization are very difficult and costly. To establish and maintain vegetation, it is necessary to topdress with better suited material.

Numerical ratings between 0.00 and 0.99 are given after the specified features. These numbers indicate the degree to which the features limit the soils as sources of reclamation material. The lower the number, the greater the limitation.

Roadfill is soil material that is excavated in one place and used in road embankments in another place. The soils are rated as a source of roadfill for low embankments, generally less than 6 feet high and less exacting in design than higher embankments. The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet. It is assumed that soil layers will be mixed when the soil material is excavated and spread.

22|"Gravel Source"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"ENG - Engineering

Gravel consists of natural aggregates (2 to 75 millimeters in diameter) suitable for commercial use with a minimum of processing. It is used in many kinds of construction. Specifications for each use vary widely. Only the probability of finding material in suitable quantity is evaluated. The suitability of the material for specific purposes is not evaluated, nor are factors that affect excavation of the material.

The properties used to evaluate the soil as a source of gravel are gradation of grain sizes (as indicated by the Unified classification of the soil), the thickness of suitable material, and the content of rock fragments. If the bottom layer of the soil contains gravel, the soil is considered a likely source regardless of thickness. The assumption is that the gravel layer below the depth of observation exceeds the minimum thickness. The ratings are for the whole soil, from the surface to a depth of about 6 feet. Coarse fragments of soft bedrock, such as shale and siltstone, are not considered to be gravel.

The soils are rated ""good,"" ""fair,"" or ""poor"" as potential sources of gravel. A rating of ""good"" or ""fair"" means that the source material is likely to be in or below the soil. The bottom layer and the thickest layer of the soils are assigned numerical ratings. These ratings indicate the likelihood that the layer is a source of gravel. The number 0.00 indicates that the layer is a poor source. The number 1.00 indicates that the layer is a good source. A number between 0.00 and 1.00 indicates the degree to which the layer is a likely source.

Picnic areas are natural or landscaped tracts used primarily for preparing meals and eating outdoors. These areas are subject to heavy foot traffic. Most vehicular traffic is confined to access roads and parking areas.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the ease of developing picnic areas and that influence trafficability and the growth of vegetation after development. Slope and stoniness are the main concerns affecting the development of picnic areas. For good trafficability, the surface of picnic areas should absorb rainfall readily, remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and not be dusty when dry. The soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, depth to a water table, ponding, flooding, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and large stones. The soil properties that affect the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and toxic substances in the soil.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

They are based on the soil properties that affect workability, the ease of digging, and the ease of moving and spreading the material over the refuse daily during wet and dry periods. These properties include soil texture, depth to a water table, ponding, rock fragments, slope, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, reaction, and content of salts, sodium, or lime.

Loamy or silty soils that are free of large stones and excess gravel are the best cover for a landfill. Clayey soils may be sticky and difficult to spread; sandy soils are subject to wind erosion.

Slope affects the ease of excavation and of moving the cover material. Also, it can influence runoff, erosion, and reclamation of the borrow area. 

The soil material used as the final cover for a landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium, salts, or lime and should not be too acid. After soil material has been removed, the soil material remaining in the borrow area must be thick enough over bedrock, a cemented pan, or the water table to permit revegetation. Some damage to the borrow area is expected, however, and plant growth may not be optimum.

This information is intended for land use planning, for evaluating land use alternatives, and for planning site investigations prior to design and construction. The information, however, has limitations. For example, estimates and other data generally apply only to that part of the soil between the surface and a depth of 5 to 7 feet. Because of the map scale, small areas of different soils may be included within the mapped areas of a specific soil.

The information is not site specific and does not eliminate the need for onsite investigation of the soils or for testing and analysis by personnel experienced in the design and construction of engineering works.

Government ordinances and regulations that restrict certain land uses or impose specific design criteria were not considered in preparing the ratings. Local ordinances and regulations should be considered in planning, in site selection, and in design.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings in the table indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.  

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit.  The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site."|||"Interpretation"|"ENG - Daily Cover for Landfill"|1|"Not rated"|0|1|0|0||0|||1|"DlyCovLFil"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|5||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""5"">

90|"Sanitary Landfill (Trench)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"ENG - Engineering

A ""trench sanitary landfill"" is an area where solid waste is placed in successive layers in an excavated trench. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil excavated at the site. When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the risk of pollution, the ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation. These properties include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, ponding, slope, flooding, texture, stones and boulders, highly organic layers, soil reaction, and content of salts and sodium. Unless otherwise stated, the ratings apply only to that part of the soil within a depth of about 6 feet. For deeper trenches, onsite investigation may be needed.

Hard, nonrippable bedrock, creviced bedrock, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed trench bottom can affect the ease of excavation and the hazard of ground-water pollution. Slope affects construction of the trenches and the movement of surface water around the landfill. It also affects the construction and performance of roads in areas of the landfill.

Soil texture and consistence affect the ease with which the trench is dug and the ease with which the soil can be used as daily or final cover. They determine the workability of the soil when dry and when wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and are difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of refuse.

The soil material used as the final cover for a trench landfill should be suitable for plants. It should not have excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. The surface layer generally has the best workability, the highest content of organic matter, and the best potential for plants. Material from the surface layer should be stockpiled for use as the final cover.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

84|"Sewage Lagoons"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"ENG - Engineering

Sewage lagoons are shallow ponds constructed to hold sewage while aerobic bacteria decompose the solid and liquid wastes. Lagoons should have a nearly level floor surrounded by cut slopes or embankments of compacted soil. Nearly impervious soil material for the lagoon floor and sides is required to minimize seepage and contamination of ground water. Considered in the ratings are slope, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, large stones, and content of organic matter.

Ksat is a critical property affecting the suitability for sewage lagoons. Most porous soils eventually become sealed when they are used as sites for sewage lagoons. Until sealing occurs, however, the hazard of pollution is severe. Soils that have a Ksat rate of more than 14 micrometers per second are too porous for the proper functioning of sewage lagoons. In these soils, seepage of the effluent can result in contamination of the ground water. Ground-water contamination is also a hazard if fractured bedrock is within a depth of 40 inches, if the water table is high enough to raise the level of sewage in the lagoon, or if floodwater overtops the lagoon.

A high content of organic matter is detrimental to proper functioning of the lagoon because it inhibits aerobic activity. Slope, bedrock, and cemented pans can cause construction problems, and large stones can hinder compaction of the lagoon floor. If the lagoon is to be uniformly deep throughout, the slope must be gentle enough and the soil material must be thick enough over bedrock or a cemented pan to make land smoothing practical.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

62|"Sanitary Landfill (Area)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"ENG - Engineering

In an ""area sanitary landfill,"" solid waste is placed in successive layers on the surface of the soil. The waste is spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil from a source away from the site. A final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the completed landfill. A landfill must be able to bear heavy vehicular traffic. It can result in the pollution of ground water. Ease of excavation and revegetation should be considered.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability and the risk of pollution. These properties include flooding, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, slope, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan. Flooding is a serious problem because it can result in pollution in areas downstream from the landfill. If Ksat is too rapid or if fractured bedrock, a fractured cemented pan, or the water table is close to the surface, the leachate can contaminate the water supply. Slope is a consideration because of the extra grading required to maintain roads in the steeper areas of the landfill. Also, leachate may flow along the surface of the soils in the steeper areas and cause difficult seepage problems.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

18|"Septic Tank Absorption Fields"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"ENG - Engineering

Septic tank absorption fields are areas in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. Only that part of the soil between depths of 24 and 60 inches is evaluated. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of the system, and public health. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and flooding affect absorption of the effluent. Stones and boulders, ice, and bedrock or a cemented pan interfere with installation. Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance. Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the effluent in downslope areas.

Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth of less than 4 feet below the distribution lines. In these soils the absorption field may not adequately filter the effluent, particularly when the system is new. As a result, the ground water may become contaminated.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use.

526|"Soil-Based Residential Wastewater Disposal Ratings (VT)"|"mapunit"|"vtsepticsyscl"|"Choice"|254||"This interpretation indicates the suitability of the soils for soil-based residential wastewater disposal systems. The ratings are based on the 2007 Vermont Environmental Protection Rules (Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, Agency of Natural Resources). This rating system replaces the system in the publication ""Ancillary Soil Interpretation Ratings for On-site Sewage Disposal in Vermont,"" published in January 1997 by the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

Included in soil-based wastewater disposal systems are absorption fields, also known as leach fields, or trenches in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. There must be unsaturated soil material beneath the absorption field to filter the effluent effectively. Unsatisfactory performance, including excessively slow absorption of effluent, surfacing of effluent, and hillside seepage, can affect public health.

The ratings are represented by symbols for five interpretive groups and their subgroups. These groups and subgroups are described in the following paragraphs.

Group I soils are well suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected. The soils in this group are sandy and gravelly soils that formed in outwash and that have rapid permeability in the substratum and well drained soils that formed in till and that have a friable substratum with moderate permeability. Slopes generally are less than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup Ia have rapid permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup Ib have rapid permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup Ic have moderate permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup Id have moderate permeability and slopes that range to more than 20 percent.

Group II soils are moderately suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes soils with moderately slow to very slow permeability; complexes in which one or more of the soils have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches); soils that would qualify for inclusion in group I but have slopes of more than 20 percent; and soils that have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more.
     	Map units in subgroup IIa have moderately slow to very slow permeability and slopes of less than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIb have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIc have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) in some areas and have slopes of less than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IId have bedrock at a moderate depth (20 to 40 inches) and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIe have rapid permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIf have moderate permeability and slopes of more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIh have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 18 inches or more and have slopes of less than 20 percent.

Group III map units are marginally suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems. Intensive onsite investigation may be needed to locate suitable areas, or special design, extra maintenance, or costly alteration may be needed to overcome the soil-related limitations. In areas where the water table is at a shallow depth, seasonal onsite monitoring of the water table may be needed to determine whether the site is suitable. Some areas of any of the map units in group III may not be suitable for soil-based wastewater disposal systems.
     	Map units in subgroup IIIa have bedrock at a depth of less than 10 inches in some areas. Some map units are limited by slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIIb are subject to flooding and have a seasonal high water table at a moderate depth.
     	Map units in subgroup IIIc have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 percent or less.
        	Map units in subgroup IIId have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 foot or less and have slopes of 8 to 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIIe generally have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 2 feet and have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIIf have a seasonal high water table and limited depth to bedrock. Some map units have slopes that range to more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IIIg have a flooding hazard.

Group IV map units are generally not suited to soil-based wastewater disposal systems because of such limitations as wetness, depth to bedrock, restricted permeability, and slope.
     	Map units in subgroup IVa are subject to excessive wetness.
     	Map units in subgroup IVb are limited by the depth to bedrock and by slopes of more than 20 percent.
     	Map units in subgroup IVc are generally not suited because of a very limited depth to bedrock and the slope.
     	Map units in subgroup IVd have moderately slow to very slow permeability and have slopes of more than 20 percent. Some map units have a seasonal high water table.

Group V map units are not rated for soil-based wastewater disposal systems. This group includes miscellaneous areas that have been filled, excavated, regraded, or otherwise disturbed by human activities; areas that are mapped above the series level, such as Udorthents; and areas of water. The miscellaneous areas and the areas mapped above the series level have a wide range of soil properties. Onsite investigation is needed to determine the suitability of these areas for soil-based wastewater disposal.

These ratings are based on the installation of a new septic system for a new single-family home on a lot subdivided on or after June 14, 2002, in a municipality that has planning and zoning bylaws. The ratings do not necessarily apply to the siting of a replacement system for an existing residence. The ratings for lots subdivided before June 14, 2002, are based on a slope limitation of 30 percent, whereas the ratings in this interpretation are based on a slope limitation of 20 percent. The ratings in this interpretation do not take into consideration some site factors that can affect the placement of septic systems, such as wellhead and source protection areas, isolation distances, and the size of the parcel.
This interpretation is intended for general planning purposes only and is not intended to replace or supersede the need for an onsite soil investigation. These ratings apply only to land within the State of Vermont."|||"Property"||||1|0|0|0||0|||-1|"SBRWDR"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2"">

2672|"ISDH Septic Tank Absorption Field (IN)"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Individual On-site Waste Water Systems

This table shows the degree and kind of soil limitations that affect conventional on-site septic systems based on the criteria provided by the Indiana State Department of Health in Rule 410 IAC 6-8.3. The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. 

""Slightly limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for the specified use. The probability is high that large enough areas with these soils and landscape characteristics occur in the mapped areas and approved for conventional septic systems in Indiana.  ""Moderately limited"" indicates that the soil has some features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The probability is moderate that areas with these soils and landscape characteristics might be approved for conventional septic systems in Indiana. In many cases, a special design or non conventional septic system may help to overcome the soil or landscape limitations. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are generally unfavorable for the specified use. The probability is low that areas with these soils and landscape characteristics might be approved for conventional septic systems in Indiana. ""Unusable"" indicates that the soil has some features that could prevent the septic system from being legally installed.  The limitations for a conventional septic system generally are difficult to overcome without major soil reclamation, and may or may not be favorable for other non conventional on-site system designs.  

Numerical ratings in the tables indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Indiana conventional septic systems are areas in which effluent from a septic tank is distributed into the soil through subsurface tiles or perforated pipe. Only that part of the soil between depths of 0 to 86 centimeters (0 to 24 inches) is evaluated. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption of the effluent, construction and maintenance of the system, and public health. Permeability, depth to a water table, and depth to bedrock or a densic layer affect absorption of the effluent. Urban areas, altered soils, and fill material were not rated. Slopes greater than 15 percent and flooding are considered site limiting for Indiana conventional septic systems, but these limitations need to be confirmed by on-site evaluations.

This report should be used only as a general guide to soil limitations for Indiana conventional septic systems. The information is not site-specific and does not in any way eliminate or replace the need for onsite investigation of the soils, or for testing and analysis by personnel experienced in the design and construction of engineering works. Information in this table is intended for general land use planning, for evaluating land use alternatives, and for planning on-site investigations prior to approval and design of a system.  Because of the scale at which the maps were made, small areas of different soils are included within most areas identified in the map unit name as a particular soil or soils.  In addition, the limitations ratings are based on a representative depth for some soil properties, within the range of depths that was mapped.  Areas of similar soils with different depths to these soil features will occur within all mapped areas and could have different limitations.  These areas can only be determined and located by an on-site investigation.

Government ordinances and regulations that restrict certain land uses or impose specific design criteria were not considered in preparing the information in this table. Local ordinances and regulations must be fully considered in planning, site selection, and design. Contact the Indiana State Department of Health for more information about conventional and alternative septic systems in Indiana."|||"Interpretation"|"ISDH Septic Tank Interpretation (IN)"|1|"Not rated"|0|1|0|0||0|||1|"value"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|5||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""5"">

The ratings in this interpretation indicate the hazard of surface rut formation through the operation of forestland equipment. Soil displacement and puddling (soil deformation and compaction) may occur simultaneously with rutting.

Ratings are based on depth to a water table, rock fragments on or below the surface, the Unified classification of the soil, depth to a restrictive layer, and slope. The hazard is described as slight, moderate, or severe. A rating of ""slight"" indicates that the soil is subject to little or no rutting. ""Moderate"" indicates that rutting is likely. ""Severe"" indicates that ruts form readily.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the specified aspect of forestland management (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

10|"Potential for Damage by Fire"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"FOR - Forestry

The ratings in this interpretation indicate the potential for damage to nutrient, physical, and biotic soil characteristics by fire. The ratings involve an evaluation of the potential impact of prescribed fires or wildfires that are intense enough to remove the duff layer and consume organic matter in the surface layer.

The ratings are based on texture of the surface layer, content of rock fragments and organic matter in the surface layer, thickness of the surface layer, and slope. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. The soils are described as having a ""low,"" ""moderate,"" or ""high"" potential for this kind of damage. ""Low"" indicates that fire damage is unlikely. Good performance can be expected, and little or no maintenance is needed. ""Moderate"" indicates that fire damage can occur because one or more soil properties are less than desirable. Fair performance can be expected, and some maintenance is needed. ""High"" indicates that fire damage can occur because of one or more soil properties and that overcoming the unfavorable properties requires special design, extra maintenance, and costly alteration.

Numerical ratings indicate gradations between the point at which the potential for fire damage is highest (1.00) and the point at which the potential is lowest (0.00).

Ratings for this interpretation indicate the expected difficulty of hand planting of forestland plants. The ratings are based on slope, depth to a restrictive layer, content of sand, plasticity index, rock fragments on or below the surface, depth to a water table, and ponding. It is assumed that necessary site preparation is completed before seedlings are planted.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the degree to which the soils are suited to this aspect of forestland management. ""Well suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are favorable for the specified management aspect and has no limitations. Good performance can be expected, and little or no maintenance is needed. ""Moderately suited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified management aspect. One or more soil properties are less than desirable, and fair performance can be expected. Some maintenance is needed. ""Poorly suited"" indicates that the soil has one or more properties that are unfavorable for the specified management aspect. Overcoming the unfavorable properties requires special design, extra maintenance, and costly alteration. ""Unsuited"" indicates that the expected performance of the soil is unacceptable for the specified management aspect or that extreme measures are needed to overcome the undesirable soil properties.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the specified aspect of forestland management (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The ratings in this interpretation indicate the hazard of soil loss from off-road and off-trail areas after disturbance activities that expose the soil surface. The ratings are based on slope, soil erosion factor K, and an index of rainfall erosivity (R). The soil loss is caused by sheet or rill erosion in off-road or off-trail areas where 50 to 75 percent of the surface has been exposed by logging, grazing, mining, or other kinds of disturbance.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. The hazard is described as ""slight,"" ""moderate,"" ""severe,"" or ""very severe."" A rating of ""slight"" indicates that erosion is unlikely under ordinary climatic conditions; ""moderate"" indicates that some erosion is likely and that erosion-control measures may be needed; ""severe"" indicates that erosion is very likely and that erosion-control measures, including revegetation of bare areas, are advised; and ""very severe"" indicates that significant erosion is expected, loss of soil productivity and off-site damage are likely, and erosion-control measures are costly and generally impractical.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

The ratings for Pesticide Loss Potential-Leaching are used for evaluating and determining the potential of the soil to transmit pesticides through the profile and the likelihood of the contamination of ground-water supplies. Evaluations consider movement of water through the soil and underlying fractured bedrock. Ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. The properties that affect the pesticide loss potential include the soil's hydrologic group, depth to water table, saturated hydraulic conductivity at different depths, and the possibility of water movement in fractured bedrock.
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that have low leaching potential. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately rated for leaching potential. Some leaching can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable and leaching potential is high.
Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The properties that affect the pesticide loss potential include the occurrence of permafrost, surface ponding, flooding, and slope.
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that have low runoff potential. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately rated for runoff potential. Some runoff can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable and surface runoff is high.
Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).
The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as that listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is given so that the user will realize the percentage of each map unit that has the specified rating.  
A map unit may have other components with different ratings.  The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site."|||"Interpretation"|"AGR - Pesticide Loss Potential-Soil Surface Runoff"|1|"Not rated"|0|1|0|0||0|||1|"plpRunoff"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|5||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""5"">

The ratings for Ground Penetrating Radar Penetration are based on the soil properties that affect the penetration of GPR signals into the soil. Soil properties affecting the penetration are considered. In many soils, high amounts of signal attenuation severely restrict radar penetration depths and limit the suitability of GPR for a large number of applications. The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use. The properties that affect signal penetration include clay content, water saturation, organic matter content, carbonate content, sulfate content, salinity, and sodicity. 
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Very high penentration"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance can be expected. ""High penetration"" grading to ""Very low penetration"" indicates that the soil has features that are less favorable for the radar penetration. ""Unsuited"" indicates that the soil has features that will not let radar penetrate. 
Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Fencing is the construction and maintenance of barriers for the management of animals and people. Metal or wooden posts are used when the fences are built. This interpretation is applicable where the posts are set to a depth of 24 inches or less in the soil and strands of wire are suspended between the posts.

Ratings are based on the ease of setting posts in the soil, the ease of maintaining the wire tension, and the estimated replacement and maintenance costs. Excavations for wooden posts are made by power augers or are hand dug. Metal posts are driven into the soil.
 
Depth to bedrock or a cemented pan and the content of large and small stones influence the excavation of postholes and the driving of posts. Flooding and the depth to a seasonal high water table may restrict the season of construction. Flooding also increases maintenance and replacement costs. High water tables increase maintenance costs and require deeper post settings. In areas of soils that have a high shrink-swell potential, deep post settings or rock jacks are needed to maintain vertical post alignment. Setting the posts in permanently frozen soil may result in loss of the insulation qualities of the soil and in thermokarst topography. In areas of sandy soils, aligning the posts and maintaining the desired wire tension commonly are difficult because of low soil strength. Soil blowing causes maintenance problems. Frost action results in frost heaving of the posts. Steep slopes restrict the use of power augers and the delivery of supplies. On steep slopes, surface creep during wet periods increases maintenance costs. Soil reaction and salinity affect the type of post selected and increase maintenance costs.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the specified use. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

Soil slippage potential is the hazard that a mass of soil will slip when vegetation is removed, soil water is at or near saturation, and other normal practices are applied.  Soil slippage potential classes for Indiana are estimated by interpreting slope gradient, geomorphic hillslope position, soil clay mineralogy and coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE), and depth to paralithic or lithic contact and the geologic formation of the contact material. Conditions that increase the hazard of slippage but are not considered in this rating are undercutting lower portions or loading the upper parts of a slope or altering the drainage or offsite water contribution to the site, such as through irrigation.

The ratings are verbal. Rating class terms indicate the potential to which the soils may slip based on the soil’s characteristics. Numerical ratings in the tables indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 0.33. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.33). The verbal rating is based on cumulative values of the decimal fractions where the lowest number is the most limiting.

The Indiana Soil Slippage Potential was originally designed to rate soils in the southeastern and south-central parts of the State, in MLRAs 120B, 120C, and 121. Although slippage can occur in any soil or area in the State, the soils most prone to slippage are mainly in these areas. A map of MLRA boundaries is available at http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/in/soils/?cid=nrcs144p2_031073.

This interpretation is designed to assess the suitability of soils for Forest Service single lane system roads built to specification with a natural surface. Standard specifications include a grade between 2 and 8 percent, with segments up to 12 percent; a width of about 10 to 14 feet (FSH 7709.56); and drainage structures (Copstead, Johansen, and Moll; 1998).  Roads would be designed to cross the slope, and would be constructed with a cut and fill design in order to maintain grade.  A full bench design would be used on slopes greater than 55 percent (FSH 7709.56).  

This interpretation does not consider geomorphology or geologic information relating to mass stability or landslide risk.  Identifying risk factors for mass instability would be a separate process at a local or regional scale.

Soil properties used in the interpretation criteria include slope gradient, rock fragment content, flooding and ponding frequency, depth to water table, depth to lithic bedrock, AASHTO Group Index as an indicator of soil strength, linear extensibility percent as an indicator of shrink-swell potential, and depth to permafrost.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. A ""Very well suited"" rating indicates that the soil and site have features that are very favorable for road construction and maintenance.  A ""Well suited"" rating indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for road construction and maintenance, with some minor limiting factors.   A ""Moderately suited"" rating indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for road construction and maintenance but there are some limiting factors.   A ""Poorly suited"" rating indicates that the soil has features that create significant limiting factors for road construction and maintenance.   

Soils are placed into suitability classes based on the following numerical ratings:

0.91 - 1.00:   Very well suited
0.51 - 0.90:   Well suited
0.01 - 0.50:   Moderately suited
0.00:              Poorly suited  

This interpretation can be used for:

- assessing suitability for new single lane road construction in mountainous or flat terrain, 

- assessing suitability for new Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) trails (50 inches or wider) in mountainous or flat terrain,

- describing soil suitability-related maintenance issues on existing road or OHV trail (50 inches or wider) networks.

2770|"Windthrow Hazard"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"FOR - Forestry

Windfirmness is the ability of a tree to resist overturning. It is a function of the balance between the anchorage or strength of the root/soil mass and the wind drag and gravitational forces applied on the tree crown.  Windthrow is one type of wind damage. It is the uprooting of a tree by pivoting on the outer edge of a mass of soil, rock, and roots. Windthrow occurs when the horizontal forces on a tree (wind drag) are transmitted down the trunk and create a torque that exceeds the resistance to turning of the root and soil system (Stathers et al., 1994).  The process varies depending on silvicultural practices, wind, tree species, site, and soil type. For example, individual tree characteristics contribute to windthrow. Trees with large, dense canopies are more susceptible to windthrow than those with open canopies. The strength and elasticity of the bole, branches, and leaves also contribute. The characteristics of the stand can influence the susceptibility to windthrow as well. Stand height and stand density are major factors; shorter and denser stands are more resistant to windthrow than tall, open stands. The rooting habits of the tree species impact the risk of windthrow; deeper-rooted trees are more resistant to the effects of wind than shallow-rooted species (Stathers et al., 1994). 
 
Soil and site factors are also important. According to most windthrow studies, the soil factors that control rooting depth contribute most significantly to the risk of windthrow. Rooting depth in soil can be restricted by a variety of features. Indurated, strongly cemented, and cemented layers, such as unweathered bedrock and duripans, are more or less root impenetrable. Some noncemented layers, such as fragipans, can also curtail root penetration. Persistent anoxic layers, such as a stagnant shallow water table, can act like an impervious layer. Wetness also has a deleterious effect on the shear strength of the soil, decreasing windfirmness. The weight of the soil over the roots adds a stabilizing anchoring influence. The shape of the land surface is also a factor in windthrow. While the effects are complex, the trees on certain exposed portions of the landscape are more subject to high windspeeds under most circumstances. Windspeed increases as wind streamlines are compressed by flowing through narrowing valleys, over hills and ridges, or around shoulder slopes. Wind direction is also a factor. In general, ridgetops, shoulder slopes, and backslopes tend to increase windspeed. This interpretation is intended to indicate those soil components on which the trees would be prone to windthrow.

The soil and site criteria that are considered in this soil interpretation are those that have the greatest effect on windthrow.  They include the depth to a root-limiting layer, the position of the tree on the landscape, the shape of the landscape, and the cohesiveness of the soil in which the tree is rooted.
 
Each soil and site criterion is assigned a numerical rating between 0 and 1. For this interpretation, a rating of 1 represents the least favorable soil and site characteristics and 0 represents the most favorable soil and site characteristics. Windthrow hazard is an indicator of the relative susceptibility of trees growing on a soil component to being blown over by wind. Soil and site factors, while important, are not the only factors that need to be considered in the process of windthrow. Silvicultural practices, tree species, and climatic variables are also involved.

Rating classes are defined as follows:

Severe (numerical rating of 1):  Soils and sites where windthrow is likely to occur under conditions of high winds and decreased shear strength. 

Moderate (numerical rating of 0.01 to 0.99):  Soils and sites where windthrow may occur only under conditions of extreme windspeeds and decreased shear strength. 
 
Slight (numerical rating of 0):  Soils and sites where windthrow may occur only under conditions of very extreme windspeeds and decreased shear strength.

Not Rated:  Miscellaneous areas.

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site.

2772|"Soil Displacement Hazard"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"FOR - Forestry

This interpretation is designed to predict the hazard for soil displacement from operation of ground-based equipment for forest harvesting and site preparation activities whether the soils are dry or moist. Displacement is the horizontal movement of soil caused by scraping or machine gouging. Displacement can remove the organic forest litter and upper portions of the mineral surface layer, reducing the availability of plant nutrients and the soil’s water-holding capacity. This results in a loss of site productivity for forest vegetation.

Displacement most commonly occurs during slash disposal and site preparation activities when a blade attachment is used with equipment rather than a brush rake attachment. Tractors maneuvering on dry, loose soil can also cause displacement.

Interpretation ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile. Factors considered are soil texture, rock fragment content, and thickness of surface layers with at least 1 percent organic matter. Initial ratings are based on the following soil texture groups:

Low displacement hazard:  silty clay, clay, sandy clay, silty clay loam

Medium displacement hazard:  silt, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam

High displacement hazard:  sandy loam, loamy sand, sand, ashy loam, ashy silt loam, medial loam, medial silt loam

Ratings are reduced by one class, such as from ""high"" to ""medium,"" if the surface layers with 1 percent or more percent organic matter are more than 6 inches thick. Ratings are reduced by one class for rock fragment content of 35 to 60 percent by volume and are reduced by two classes for rock fragment content of greater than 60 percent.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the soil displacement hazard.  

A ""High"" rating indicates that the soils can be readily displaced by equipment operations. They have little resistance to movement. Unless protective measures are implemented, detrimental displacement is probable.

A ""Medium"" rating indicates that the soils can be displaced by equipment operations but are intermediate in their resistance to movement.

A ""Low"" rating indicates that soils are resistant to displacement. Detrimental displacement is not likely to occur during equipment operations.

Numerical ratings indicate the soil displacement hazard. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.00. They indicate gradations between the point where displacement hazard is highest (1.00) and the point at which displacement hazard is lowest (0.00).

2773|"Soil Puddling Hazard"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"FOR - Forestry

This interpretation is designed to predict the potential for soil puddling to occur from operation of ground-based equipment for forest harvesting and site preparation activities when soils have a moisture content that is at or above field capacity. Puddling is the loss of soil structure that results from squeezing and churning of soils by tires or tracks of heavy equipment. Soil particles become dispersed in water, and after they have dried and settled, the smaller particles form a crust on the surface. Soil puddling reduces porosity and increases bulk density by reducing the interaggregate pore space.

Puddled soils are less favorable for optimal plant growth because of high soil bulk density and hardness, reduced pore space, and poor aeration and drainage. Root penetration and growth are decreased in puddled soils because the hardness or strength of these soils prevents the expansion of roots. Supplies of air, water, and nutrients that roots need are also reduced when puddling decreases soil porosity and drainage.

Interpretation ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile. Factors considered are soil texture, soil structure, and rock fragment content. Initial ratings are based on the following soil texture groups:

Low puddling potential: loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, fine sand, coarse sand, sandy loam with less than 15 percent clay

Medium puddling potential: loam, silt, silt loam with less than 15 percent clay, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam with 15 percent or more clay 

High puddling potential: silty clay, clay, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam with 15 percent or more clay

Ratings are reduced by one class, such as from ""high"" to ""medium,"" for strong soil structure grade. Ratings are reduced by one class for rock fragment content of 35 to 60 percent by volume and are reduced by two classes for rock fragment content of greater than 60 percent.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the soil puddling potential. 

A ""Low"" rating indicates that soils are resistant to puddling.

A ""Medium"" rating indicates that soils can be puddled by equipment operation, but the damage is often not extreme and mitigation measures are effective.

 A ""High"" rating indicates that soils can be readily puddled by equipment operation. Mitigation of the damage is difficult.

Numerical ratings indicate the soil puddling potential. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.00. They indicate gradations between the point where puddling potential is highest (1.00) and the point at which puddling potential is lowest (0.00).

2774|"Soil Rutting Hazard by Month"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"FOR - Forestry

Soil rutting occurs when the soil cannot support the weight of the machinery being driven across it. The degree of rutting depends upon the interaction of the contact pressure of the machine, the strength of the soil (as inferred by the AASHTO group index), and soil wetness. The soil interpretations for soil rutting hazard are used as a tool in timing heavy equipment use, evaluating soil suitability for traffic, and identifying soil limitations for operations.

The ratings in this interpretation indicate the hazard of surface rut formation through the operation of forestland equipment during the indicated month. Soil displacement and puddling (soil deformation and compaction) may occur simultaneously with rutting.

Rutting involves the displacement and movement of soil. It changes the structure of the soil and can adversely affect lateral flow of water through the landscape. Near-surface plant roots can also be damaged. Soil water content is a major factor in soil rutting because of the influence of water on the grain-to-grain cohesion of soil. The effect is most strongly pronounced in clayey soils. The deformation of soil under stress is a relatively complex process that depends on the amount and type of clay and the shapes of the various soil size separates. The process can be understood by application of the Atterberg limits. When the water content of a soil layer exceeds its plastic limit, application of a load will cause deformation. The water content at the plastic limit is generally less than the 1/3-bar water-holding capacity. It is important in timing heavy equipment usage during a rainy season, even if the soil is not saturated.

The AASHTO group index is a convenient way to rate the strength of soils because it accounts for both the fine-earth fraction of the soil and rock fragment content. The Group Index numbers are diagnostic in the range from 0 to 20; in terms of strength, soils with an index of 0 are not limited and soils with index 20 are very limited. Rock fragment content and bulk density have an effect on bearing capacity but are not considered individually in this rating.

Ratings are based on depth to a water table by month, since the depth to saturation of a soil can change monthly and it has a profound effect on soil strength. The soil conditions that affect rutting are evaluated for each month. The AASHTO group index and the depth to a restrictive layer are considered. A cemented layer close to the surface will limit the depth to which a tire or track can sink into the soil. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that affect rutting. The hazard is described as slight, moderate, or severe. A rating of ""Slight"" indicates that the soil is subject to little or no rutting. ""Moderate"" indicates that rutting is likely. ""Severe"" indicates that ruts form readily.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.00 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the specified aspect of forestland management (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.

2776|"Soil Compactibility Risk"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"FOR - Forestry

This interpretation is designed to predict the potential for soil compaction from operation of ground-based equipment for forest harvesting and site preparation activities when soils are moist. Soils are rated based on their susceptibility to compaction from the operation of ground-based equipment for planting, harvesting, and site preparation activities. Soil compaction is the process in which soil particles are pressed together more closely than in the original state. Typically, the soil must be moist to be compacted because the mineral grains must slide together. Compaction reduces the abundance mostly of large pores in the soil by damaging the structure of the soil. This produces several effects that are unwanted in forest soils since large pores are most effective at transmitting water and air through the soil. Compaction also increases the soil strength, which can limit root penetration and growth. The ability of soil to hold water is adversely affected by compaction since the large pores hold water. The degree of compaction of a soil is measured by its bulk density, which is the mass per unit volume, generally expressed in grams per cubic centimeter.

Compacted soils are less favorable for good plant growth because of high soil bulk density and hardness, reduced pore space, and poor aeration and drainage. Root penetration and growth is decreased in compacted soils because the hardness or strength of these soils prevents the expansion of roots. Supplies of air, water, and nutrients that roots need are also reduced when compaction decreases soil porosity and drainage.

Interpretative ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile. Factors considered are soil texture, soil organic matter content, soil structure, rock fragment content, and the existing bulk density. Each of these properties contributes to a soils ability to resist compaction. Organic matter in the soil provides resistance to compaction and the resilience to overcome the effects with time. Soil structure adds strength through discrete aggregates; it is the aggregates that are deformed or destroyed by the forces of compaction, thus strong soil structure lowers the susceptibility to compaction. Similarly, rock fragments in the soil can bridge and provide a framework to resist compaction. Finally, if a soil is already dense, further compaction is more difficult.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the soil compaction potential. 

Definitions of the ratings:

Low - The potential for compaction is insignificant. The soil is able to support standard equipment with minimal compaction. The soil is moisture insensitive, exhibiting only small changes in density with changing moisture content.

Medium - The potential for compaction is significant. The growth rate of seedlings may be reduced following compaction. After the initial compaction (i.e., the first equipment pass), the soil is able to support standard equipment with only minimal increases in soil density. The soil is intermediate between moisture insensitive and moisture sensitive.

High - The potential for compaction is very significant. The growth rate of seedlings will be reduced following compaction. After initial compaction, the soil is still able to support standard equipment but will continue to compact with each subsequent pass of the equipment. The soil is moisture sensitive, exhibiting large changes in density with changing moisture content.

Numerical ratings indicate the soil compaction potential. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.00. They indicate gradations between the point where compaction potential is highest (1.00) and the point at which compaction potential is lowest (0.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.

Drought Vulnerable Soils

Even in a year, having normal precipitation or slightly less than normal, some soils are prone to having drought stress occur in the plants growing on them.  Several conditions can allow this to happen.  Most influential may be a relative lack of effective precipitation, as is estimated by subtracting the mean annual precipitation from an estimate of the annual evapotranspiration. Soils west of the 100th meridian frequently fall into this situation, especially at low elevations.  Also, a soil may have an inherently low ability to store water.  This is typical of sandy or shallow soils or soils having a high content of rock fragments.  In this case, even though there may be significant rainfall, the soil matrix does not retain sufficient water for crop growth.

Topographic and climatic characteristics can be present to mitigate a soil's droughty tendacies.  Some soils exist on water-gathering portions of the landscape and can thus support more plant growth than their similar neighbors because of run on. Some soils have a water table present within the rooting zone during the growing season to supply plant water needs.  Finally, some soils exist in a climate where precipitation is much higher than evapotranspiration and the soil is nearly always moist.  This can occur in cool climates at high elevations.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are vulnerable to drought. Numerical ratings indicate the degree of vulnerability associated with each soil or site feature. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature imparts the greatest degree of vulnerability (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature helps to mitigate drought vulnerability (0.00).

Verbal ratings are defined as follows: 

Severely drought vulnerable (rating index equals 1.0).  The soil and site properties present are such that the plants growing on the soil must be very drought tolerant even in years with normal amounts of rainfall.  The soil may have very low water storage capacity (below 5 cm) or may be in an area of low annual precipitation or high annual temperature or both. 

Drought vulnerable (rating index is greater than 0.67 but less than 1.0).  The soil and site properties are such that drought conditions generally occur every year.  The soil may have low water storage capacity (5 to 15 cm) and the site may have low annual precipitation or high annual temperature or both. 

Moderately drought vulnerable (rating index is greater than 0.33 but less than 0.67).  The soil and site proerties are such that in an average year, some water stress may occur, but in a good year, plant available water is generally adequate. Water storage is in the range of 15 to 25 cm.  Rainfall and estimated potential evapotranspiration are nearly equal. 

Somewhat drought vulnerable (rating index is greater than 0 but less than 0.33).  These soils have greater than 25 cm of water storage and annual precipitation is generally adequate for plant growth.  In dry years some water stress may occur. 

Slightly drought vulnerable (rating index equals 0).  These soils are either in lowlying parts of the landscape where plant roots may exploit near-surface ground water or are in areas where precipitation is much higher than potential evapotranspitration.  In an extremely dry year plants may be water stressed on these soils.

Soil Suitability for Industrial Hemp for Fiber and Seed

Industrial hemp produced for fiber and seed is seeing a resurgence in interest from farmers in many states.  Although commonly cultivated in the United States prior to the 1940s, it fell out of vogue with the advent of other materials for producing rope and textiles.  Industrial hemp is a non-drug variety of Cannabis sativa which has very low levels (less than 0.3%) of the psychoactive compound, tetrahydracannabinal (THC).  It is a highly productive plant which can grow in a variety of climate and soil conditions.  Any machinery that is easily adjustable, such as row widths, and performs well is suitable for sowing industrial hemp. Standard grain drills and modified alfalfa seeders are examples of suitable machinery. Ease of converting farm equipment to sow seeds makes this an appealing alternative. Ideally, industrial hemp should be incorporated into a four-year crop rotation. Industrial hemp does require an adequate amount of nutrients. Major nutrients include but, not limited to: (1) nitrogen, (2) potassium, and (3) phosphorus. Industrial hemp's dense canopy  makes for effective weed suppression. 

Industrial hemp requires certain soil and site characteristics for optimum growth.  Slope, soil drainage, depth to a restrictive layer, frost-free days, ponding, flooding, rock fragment cover, and rock fragment content are important characteristics that are not easily altered.  If any one of these attributes is unsuited for growing a crop, then the site is not suited.  Other soil characteristics, such as available water storage, organic matter content, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and hydraulic conductivity, while important, will generally not render a soil unsuited if one or two of these characteristics is sub-optimal.  Also, these characteristics can be made more suitable when the soil is managed for optimal soil health. 

Two things need to be remembered about the ""Industrial Hemp for Fiber and Seed Production"" model.  First, it is important to consider that this interpretation describes the suitability of a soil and site for industrial hemp production and does not necessarily imply a predicted yield, although better suited soils may be more productive.  Second, the model assumes that if the crop needs to be irrigated due to insufficient precipitation, then water at appropriate levels will be applied.  European studies show that industrial hemp requires 500 to 700 mm of moisture for optimum yield.  Thus, annual precipitation will need to be higher than that range, depending on the soil and evapotranspiration.  Research in the Midwest suggests 600 to 800mm of annual precipitation is needed.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are suited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. Numerical ratings indicate the degree of suitability of each soil or site feature. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest degree of suitability for the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not suited for the use (0.00).

Verbal ratings are defined as follows: 

Well suited (rating index equals 1.0). —The soil and site properties present are optimal for the growth of hemp for seed and fiber.  

Suited (rating index is greater than 0.75 but less than 1.0). —The soil and site properties are generally suited, but not optimal.  The site may be sloping, have seasonal saturation, or have soil chemical or physical properties that may slightly limit the growth of hemp. 

Moderately suited (rating index is greater than 0.25 but less than 0.75). —The soil and site properties are generally suited, but not well suited.  The site may be sloping, have seasonal saturation, or have soil chemical or physical properties that may limit the growth of hemp. The crop will grow and produce on these sites, but harvest may be more difficult if the soil is sloping.

Poorly suited (rating index is greater than 0 but less than 0.25). —The suitability of the site is marginal for the management and production of the crop.  While hemp will grow and produce a crop, it may not be of an economic quantity.  

Not suited (rating index equals 0). —The soil is rendered unsuitable for hemp production due to very unfavorable conditions, such as excessive slope, severe wetness, or poor physical and chemical soil properties.

78|"Disposal of Wastewater by Irrigation"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Wastewater includes municipal and food-processing wastewater and effluent from lagoons or storage ponds. Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality. It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste. It may have received primary or secondary treatment. It is rarely untreated sewage. Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption. In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride. The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste. Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter. The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste. The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

Disposal of wastewater by irrigation not only disposes of municipal wastewater and wastewater from food-processing plants, lagoons, and storage ponds but also can improve crop production by increasing the amount of water available to crops. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect the design, construction, management, and performance of the irrigation system. The properties that affect design and management include the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a water table, ponding, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), slope, and flooding. The properties that affect construction include stones, cobbles, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, depth to a water table, and ponding. The properties that affect performance include depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, bulk density, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, reaction, and the cation-exchange capacity, which is used to estimate the capacity of a soil to adsorb heavy metals. Permanently frozen soils are not suitable for disposal of wastewater by irrigation.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect agricultural waste management. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

57|"Disposal of Wastewater by Rapid Infiltration"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Rapid infiltration of wastewater is a process in which wastewater applied in a level basin at a rate of 4 to 120 inches per week percolates through the soil. The wastewater may eventually reach the ground water. The application rate commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland. Vegetation is not a necessary part of the treatment; thus, the basins may or may not be vegetated. The thickness of the soil material needed for proper treatment of the wastewater is more than 72 inches. As a result, geologic and hydrologic investigation is needed to ensure proper design and performance and to determine the risk of ground-water pollution.

Soil properties are important considerations in areas where soils are used as sites for the treatment and disposal of organic waste and wastewater. Selection of soils with properties that favor waste management can help to prevent environmental damage.

The wastewater leaves solids and nutrients on the vegetated surfaces as it flows downslope in a thin film.

Manure is the excrement of livestock and poultry, and food-processing waste is damaged fruit and vegetables and the peelings, stems, leaves, pits, and soil particles removed in food preparation. The manure and food-processing waste are solid, slurry, or liquid. Their nitrogen content varies. A high content of nitrogen limits the application rate. Toxic or otherwise dangerous wastes, such as those mixed with the lye used in food processing, are not considered in the ratings.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, erodibility, the rate at which the waste is applied, and the method by which the waste is applied. The properties that affect absorption include saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and available water capacity. The properties that affect plant growth and microbial activity include reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density. The wind erodibility group, soil erosion factor K, and slope are considered in estimating the likelihood that wind erosion or water erosion will transport the waste material from the application site.

24|"Slow Rate Treatment of Wastewater"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Slow rate treatment of wastewater is a process in which wastewater is applied to land at a rate normally between 0.5 inch and 4.0 inches per week. The application rate commonly exceeds the rate needed for irrigation of cropland. The applied wastewater is treated as it moves through the soil. Much of the treated water may percolate to the ground water, and some enters the atmosphere through evapotranspiration. The applied water generally is not allowed to run off the surface. Waterlogging is prevented either through control of the application rate or through the use of tile drains, or both.

Soil properties are important considerations in areas where soils are used as sites for the treatment and disposal of organic waste and wastewater. Selection of soils with properties that favor waste management can help to prevent environmental damage.

Municipal wastewater is the waste stream from a municipality. It contains domestic waste and may contain industrial waste. It may have received primary or secondary treatment. It is rarely untreated sewage. Food-processing wastewater results from the preparation of fruits, vegetables, milk, cheese, and meats for public consumption. In places it is high in content of sodium and chloride. The effluent in lagoons and storage ponds is from facilities used to treat or store food-processing wastewater or domestic or animal waste. Domestic and food-processing wastewater is very dilute, and the effluent from the facilities that treat or store it commonly is very low in content of carbonaceous and nitrogenous material; the content of nitrogen commonly ranges from 10 to 30 milligrams per liter. The wastewater from animal waste treatment lagoons or storage ponds, however, has much higher concentrations of these materials, mainly because the manure has not been diluted as much as the domestic waste. The content of nitrogen in this wastewater generally ranges from 50 to 2,000 milligrams per liter. When wastewater is applied, checks should be made to ensure that nitrogen, heavy metals, and salts are not added in excessive amounts.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, erodibility, and the application of waste. The properties that affect absorption include the sodium adsorption ratio, depth to a water table, ponding, available water capacity, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, reaction, the cation-exchange capacity, and slope. Reaction, the sodium adsorption ratio, salinity, and bulk density affect plant growth and microbial activity. The wind erodibility group, soil erosion factor K, and slope are considered in estimating the likelihood of wind erosion or water erosion. Stones, cobbles, a water table, ponding, and flooding can hinder the application of waste. Permanently frozen soils are unsuitable for waste treatment.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect agricultural waste management. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.

17|"Land Application of Municipal Sewage Sludge"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Application of sewage sludge not only disposes of waste material but also can improve crop production by increasing the supply of nutrients in the soils where the material is applied. Sewage sludge is the residual product of the treatment of municipal sewage. The solid component consists mainly of cell mass, primarily bacteria cells that developed during secondary treatment and have incorporated soluble organics into their own bodies. The sludge has small amounts of sand, silt, and other solid debris. The content of nitrogen varies. Some sludge has constituents that are toxic to plants or hazardous to the food chain, such as heavy metals and exotic organic compounds, and should be analyzed chemically prior to use.

The content of water in the sludge ranges from about 98 percent to less than 40 percent. The sludge is considered liquid if it is more than about 90 percent water, slurry if it is about 50 to 90 percent water, and solid if it is less than about 50 percent water.

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect absorption, plant growth, microbial activity, erodibility, the rate at which the sludge is applied, and the method by which the sludge is applied.

The ratings apply to the soil material below the surface layer to a depth of about 5 feet. It is assumed that soil layers will be uniformly mixed and compacted during construction.

The ratings do not indicate the suitability of the undisturbed soil for supporting the embankment.

Subsurface micro-irrigation systems are buried and apply water directly and very slowly to the root zone.  Generally, these systems are very efficient in terms of both water and energy use and are suitable for use in windbreaks, vegetables, berries, landscape plantings, vineyards, orchards, and some row crops.  The ratings are for soils in their natural condition and do not consider present land use.

The soil properties and qualities important in the design and management of subsurface micro-irrigation systems are soil depth, available water capacity, wetness or ponding, saturated hydraulic conductivity, pH (soil reaction), erosion potential, and flooding.  The soil properties and qualities that influence installation are soil depth, stoniness, flooding, and ponding.  The features that affect performance of the system and plant growth are available water capacity, shrink-swell potential, pH (soil reaction), and the content (or amount) of salts, calcium carbonate, and sodium.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect the interpretation. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by the soil features that affect the soil interpretation.  Verbal soil rating classes are based on the highest numerical rating for the most limiting soil feature(s) considered in the rating process.  ""Not limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 0.00) indicates that the soil has no limiting features for the specified use.  ""Somewhat limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature =.01 to .99) indicates that the soil has limiting features for the specified use that can be overcome with proper planning, design, installation, and management.  The effort required to overcome a soil limitation increases as the numerical rating increases.  ""Very limited"" (numerical value for the most restrictive feature = 1.00) indicates that the soil has one or more very limiting features that can only be overcome with special planning, major soil modification, special design, or significant management practices.

Lesser soil restrictive features have a lower numerical value than the maximum used to rate the soil, and they are identified to provide the user with additional information about soil limitations for the specific use.  Lesser soil restrictive features also need to be considered in planning, design, installation, and management.

These systems include rain gardens, bioretention basins, and infiltration basins. They slow the movement of stormwater to surface waters and also filter a significant portion of pollutants from the stormwater.  The fundamental function of these systems is to hold the runoff generated from the first 1 inch of rainfall during a 24-hour storm preceded by 48 hours of no measurable precipitation. There should be little or no ponding at the surface. The water should infiltrate into the surrounding soil in 24 to 48 hours. Only that part of the soil between depths of 24 and 80 inches is evaluated. 

The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect infiltration of the stormwater, construction and maintenance of the system, and public safety and health. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), depth to a water table, ponding, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, and flooding affect the transmission of rainwater. Stones and boulders, ice, and bedrock or a cemented pan interfere with installation. Subsidence interferes with installation and maintenance. Excessive slope may cause lateral seepage and surfacing of the water in downslope areas. Some slopes may become unstable and move upon addition of water.  

Some soils are underlain by loose sand and gravel or fractured bedrock at a depth of less than 4 feet below the bottom of the system. In these soils the deep infiltration system may not adequately filter the stormwater, particularly if the adsorptive capacity of the soil below the system is low. As a result, the ground water may become contaminated. In areas underlain by limestone, solution channels and subsequent subsidence may damage adjacent infrastructure.

471|"Soil Taxonomy Classification"|"component"|"taxclname"|"String"|120||"This rating presents the taxonomic classification based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the classification of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

191|"Conservation Tree and Shrub Group"|"component"|"constreeshrubgrp"|"Choice"|254||"Each tree and shrub species has certain climatic and physiographic limits. Within these parameters, trees and shrubs may be well suited or poorly suited to a given environment because of climate or site or soil characteristics. On the basis of the performance of individual species to specific conditions of soil, climate, physiography, and management, Conservation Tree and Shrub Groups (CTSGs) have been developed. Individual soils have been grouped with similar soils into one of the 10 main CTSGs. Most of these main groups are further divided into subgroups.

This interpretation provides guidance in selecting the species best suited to each of the groups of soils within each vegetative zone. It also can be used for predicting survival, height, growth, species attributes, and effectiveness and for selecting species for windbreaks, riparian plantings, recreation and wildlife plantings, and ornamental or environmental plantings.

Tree and shrub species associated with each CTSG are broken down by vegetative zones (rainfall zones). These lists are available in the local office of the USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, or on the Web in the electronic Field Office Technical Guide. Because vegetative zones are rather large, climatic differences within a zone should be considered when species are recommended for planting. For example, some species adapted to the eastern end of a zone may be inadequately adapted to the western end. Care must be taken to ensure that conditions on individual sites are considered when species suitability and performance are determined. A case-by-case decision may be necessary to determine which CTSG is most appropriate when an individual site has characteristics that differ from those of the CTSG in which it occurs. These differences occur because of inclusions of other soils, site modifications (such as leveling and drainage manipulation), soil pH (calcareous sites), irrigation, soil amendments, or other factors."|||"Property"||||0|1|0|0||0|||-1|"ConsTSG"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|7||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""7"">

523|"NH Forest Soil Group"|"mapunit"|"nhiforsoigrp"|"Choice"|254||"NH Forest Soil Groups (NHFSGs) consist of map units that are similar in their potential for commercial forest products, their suitability for native tree growth, and their use and management. Considered in grouping the map units are depth to bedrock, texture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, available water capacity, drainage class, and slope. The grouping applies only to soils in the State of New Hampshire.

The NHFSGs have been developed to help land users and managers in New Hampshire evaluate the relative productivity of soils and to better understand patterns of plant succession and how soil and site interactions influence management decisions. The soils are assigned to one of five groups (IA, IB, IC, IIA, and IIB). Several map units in New Hampshire either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG (NC). Examples of NC map units are very poorly drained soils and soils at high elevations. The kinds of tree species generally growing in climax stands in each of the five NHFSGs vary from county to county. This information is available through local NRCS field offices. 


IA--This group consists of very deep, loamy, moderately well drained or well drained soils. Generally, these soils are more fertile than other soils and have the most favorable soil moisture relationships. 

IB--The soils in this group are generally sandy or loamy over sandy material and are slightly less fertile than group IA soils.  Group IB soils are moderately well drained or well drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good tree growth, but it may not be quite as abundant as that in group IA soils. 

IC--The soils in this group are in areas of outwash sand and gravel. They are moderately well to excessively drained. Their soil moisture is adequate for good softwood growth but is limited for hardwoods. 

IIA--This diverse group includes many of the same soils as those in groups IA and IB. The soils are separated into a unique group, however, because they have physical limitations that make forest management more difficult and costly, i.e., steep slopes, bedrock outcrops, erosive textures, surface boulders, and extreme rockiness. 

IIB--The soils in this group are poorly drained. The seasonal high water table is generally within 12 inches of the surface. Productivity is generally less than that of soils in the other groups. 

NC--The map units in this category either vary so greatly or have such a limited potential for commercial forest products that they have not been assigned to an NHFSG. Commonly, onsite visit would be required to evaluate the situation."|||"Property"||||1|0|0|0||0|||-1|"NHFsg"||||||||0||||"Centimeters"|0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|2||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""2""><ColorRampType type=""2"" name=""Defined"" /><Legend_Symbols shapeType=""polygon""><Styles fillStyle=""esriSFSSolid"" /><Font type=""Times New Roman"" size=""8"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /><Line type=""outline"" width=""0.4"" red=""0"" green=""0"" blue=""0"" /></Legend_Symbols><Legend_Elements transparency=""0""><Labels value=""Group IA"" label=""Group IA"" order=""1""><Color red=""0"" green=""176"" blue=""80"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IB"" label=""Group IB"" order=""2""><Color red=""255"" green=""255"" blue=""0"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IC"" label=""Group IC"" order=""3""><Color red=""255"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIA"" label=""Group IIA"" order=""4""><Color red=""153"" green=""102"" blue=""51"" /></Labels><Labels value=""Group IIB"" label=""Group IIB"" order=""5""><Color red=""255"" green=""204"" blue=""102"" /></Labels><Labels value=""NC"" label=""NC"" order=""6""><Color red=""255"" green=""175"" blue=""234"" /></Labels></Legend_Elements></Map_Legend>"|1|11/03/2011 10:24:20|"No Aggregation Necessary"||1|"Choice"
16|"Hydric Rating by Map Unit"|"component"|"hydricrating"|"Choice"|254||"This rating indicates the percentage of map units that meets the criteria for hydric soils. Map units are composed of one or more map unit components or soil types, each of which is rated as hydric soil or not hydric. Map units that are made up dominantly of hydric soils may have small areas of minor nonhydric components in the higher positions on the landform, and map units that are made up dominantly of nonhydric soils may have small areas of minor hydric components in the lower positions on the landform. Each map unit is rated based on its respective components and the percentage of each component within the map unit. 

The thematic map is color coded based on the composition of hydric components. The five color classes are separated as 100 percent hydric components, 66 to 99 percent hydric components, 33 to 65 percent hydric components, 1 to 32 percent hydric components, and less than one percent hydric components.

In Web Soil Survey, the Summary by Map Unit table that is displayed below the map pane contains a column named 'Rating'.  In this column the percentage of each map unit that is classified as hydric is displayed.

Hydric soils are defined by the National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS) as soils that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part (Federal Register, 1994). Under natural conditions, these soils are either saturated or inundated long enough during the growing season to support the growth and reproduction of hydrophytic vegetation. 

The NTCHS definition identifies general soil properties that are associated with wetness. In order to determine whether a specific soil is a hydric soil or nonhydric soil, however, more specific information, such as information about the depth and duration of the water table, is needed. Thus, criteria that identify those estimated soil properties unique to hydric soils have been established (Federal Register, 2002). These criteria are used to identify map unit components that normally are associated with wetlands. The criteria used are selected estimated soil properties that are described in ""Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 1999) and ""Keys to Soil Taxonomy"" (Soil Survey Staff, 2006) and in the ""Soil Survey Manual"" (Soil Survey Division Staff, 1993). 

If soils are wet enough for a long enough period of time to be considered hydric, they should exhibit certain properties that can be easily observed in the field. These visible properties are indicators of hydric soils. The indicators used to make onsite determinations of hydric soils are specified in ""Field Indicators of Hydric Soils in the United States"" (Hurt and Vasilas, 2006).

NCCPI - National Commodity Crop Productivity Index

National Commodity Crop Productivity Index is a method of arraying the soils of the United States for non-irrigated commodity crop production based on their inherent soil properties.  This version features a separate index for soybeans.  In the past, soybeans and corn were considered together.  The rating a soil is assigned is the highest one of four basic crop group indices, which are based on the climate where the crop is typically grown.  Cooler climates are represented by winter wheat, moderate climates are represented by corn and soybeans, and warmer climates are represented by cotton.  (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_050734.pdf)

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet).  Soil, site, and climate properties that influence the growth of crops are major considerations. Soil productivity is influenced by many soil properties.  An ideal soil will store adequate amounts of water to nurture the crop between rains.  This soil will have a near-neutral pH, will store nutrients, and lack toxic materials.  The soil will have no barriers, either physical or chemical, to root growth.  Water and gas transmission through the soil will be sufficient to maintain both water and oxygen at sufficient levels in the root zone.   The soil will not be saturated with water during the growing season to the point that root growth is inhibited.  The soil will not be subject to excessive flooding or ponding during the growing season.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects erosion by water, runoff, and the operation of equipment.  The climate must provide adequate water and heat to allow the desired crop to mature.  A soil that differs from the ideal in any of these features will have lower inherent productivity for a particular crop.  The further a soil differs from ideality in any one or all of the factors that determine inherent productivity, the lower its inherent productivity will be. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the estimated productivity which is determined by all of the soil, site, and climatic features that affect crop productivity. ""High inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil, site, and climate have features that are very favorable for crop production. High yields and low risk of crop failure can be expected if a high level of management is employed. ""Moderately high inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally quite favorable for crop production.  Good yields and moderately low risk of crop failure can be expected. ""Moderate inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for crop production.  Good yields and moderate risk of crop failure can be expected.  ""Moderately low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally not favorable for crop production.  Low yields and moderately high risk of crop failure can be expected.   ""Low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for crop production.  Low yields and high risk of crop failure can be expected.  

Numerical ratings indicate the overall productivity of the soil. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01. They indicate gradations between the point at which the combination of soil, site, and climate features has the greatest positive impact on inherent productivity (1.00) and the point at which the soil features are very unfavorable (0.01). 

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.  

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site."|||"Interpretation"|"NCCPI - National Commodity Crop Productivity Index (Ver 3.0)"|2||0|1|0|0||0|||1|"NCCPI"||||||||0|||||0|||"Weighted Average"|0|0||1|6||"<Map_Legend maplegendkey=""6"">

NCCPI - National Commodity Crop Productivity Index

NCCPI - NCCPI Small Grains Productivity is a method of arraying the soils of the United States for non-irrigated small grain productivity based on their inherent soil properties.  The particular crop modeled is winter wheat.  More specific models are pending.  For more information, see (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcs142p2_050734.pdf)

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings. 

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 feet). Soil, site, and climate properties that influence the growth of small grains are major considerations. Soil productivity is influenced by many soil properties. An ideal soil will store adequate amounts of water to nurture the crop between rains. This soil will have a near-neutral pH, will store nutrients, and lack toxic materials. The soil will have no barriers, either physical or chemical, to root growth. Water and gas transmission through the soil will be sufficient to maintain both water and oxygen at sufficient levels in the root zone. The soil will not be saturated with water during the growing season to the point that root growth is inhibited. The soil will not be subject to excessive flooding or ponding during the growing season. Slope is an important consideration because it affects erosion by water, runoff, and the operation of equipment. The climate must provide adequate water and heat to allow the desired crop to mature. A soil that differs from the ideal in any of these features will have lower inherent productivity for a particular crop. The further a soil differs from ideality in any one or all of the factors that determine inherent productivity, the lower its inherent productivity will be. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the estimated productivity which is determined by all of the soil, site, and climatic features that affect crop productivity. ""High inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil, site, and climate have features that are very favorable for small grains production. High yields and low risk of crop failure can be expected if a high level of management is employed. ""Moderately high inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally quite favorable for small grains production. Good yields and moderately low risk of crop failure can be expected. ""Moderate inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally favorable for small grains production. Good yields and moderate risk of crop failure can be expected. ""Moderately low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has features that are generally not favorable for small grains production. Low yields and moderately high risk of crop failure can be expected. ""Low inherent productivity"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for small grains production. Low yields and high risk of crop failure can be expected. 

Numerical ratings indicate the overall productivity of the soil. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 1.00 to 0.01. They indicate gradations between the point at which the combination of soil, site, and climate features has the greatest positive impact on inherent productivity (1.00) and the point at which the soil features are very unfavorable (0.01). 

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented. 

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site.

2729|"Order of Soil Survey"|"mapunit"|"invesintens"|"Choice"|254||"The Order of a soil survey indicates the level of detail and relative intensity of field observation under which the map unit was developed.  The order of a survey is commonly reflected in the scale of mapping, but not determined by it. Rather, the order of a survey is determined by the field procedures used to identify soil components and place map unit boundaries, the minimum permissible size of map unit delineation, and the kind of map unit to which soil components are aggregated.

Order 1 - Very intensive.  The soils in each delineation are identified by transecting or traversing or even grid mapping. Soil boundaries are observed throughout their length. Remotely sensed data are used as an aid in boundary delineation.  Order 1 surveys are made if very detailed information about soils, generally in small areas, is needed for very intensive land uses.

Order 2 - Intensive.  The soils in each delineation are identified by field observations and by remotely sensed data. Boundaries are verified at closely spaced intervals.  Order 2 surveys are made if detailed information about soil resources is needed to make predictions of soil suitability and treatment needs for intensive land uses. The information can be used in planning for general agriculture, construction, urban development, and similar uses that require precise knowledge of the soils and their variability.

Order 3 - Extensive.  Soil boundaries are plotted by observation and interpretation of remotely sensed data. They are verified by traversing representative areas and by some transects.  Order 3 surveys are made where land uses do not require precise knowledge of small areas or detailed soil information. The survey areas are commonly dominated by a single land use and have few subordinate uses. The soil information can be used in planning for range, forest, and recreational areas and in community planning.

Order 4 - Extensive. Soil boundaries are plotted by interpretation of remotely sensed data. They are verified by traversing representative areas and by some transects.  Order 4 surveys are made if general soil information is needed about the potential and general management of land for extensive uses. The information can be used in locating, comparing, and selecting suitable areas for major kinds of land use, in regional land use planning, and in selecting areas for more intensive study and investigation.

Order 5 - Very extensive.  The soil patterns and composition of map units are determined by mapping representative ideas and like areas by interpretation of remotely sensed data. Soils are verified by some onsite investigation or by traversing. Order 5 surveys are made to collect soil information in very large areas at a level of detail suitable for planning regional land use and interpreting information at a high level of generalization. The primary use of this information is selection of areas for more intensive study.

Some soil survey areas have two or more orders of mapping because they have distinct parts with different needs.  For example, one part may be mapped to make predictions related to irrigation and the other may be mapped to make predictions related to range management. For the irrigated part, areas are mapped at the intensity required for an order 2 soil survey. For the rangeland part, areas are mapped as an order 3 survey.

2871|"Soil Taxonomy Order"|"component"|"taxorder"|"Choice"|254||"This rating presents the taxonomic order based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the order of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

2872|"Soil Taxonomy Suborder"|"component"|"taxsuborder"|"Choice"|254||"This rating presents the taxonomic suborder based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the suborder of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

2874|"Soil Taxonomy Subgroup"|"component"|"taxsubgrp"|"Choice"|254||"This rating presents the taxonomic subgroup based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements. This table shows the subgroup of the soils in the survey area. The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

2875|"Soil Taxonomy Particle Size or Substitute Class"|"component"|"taxpartsize"|"Choice"|254||"This rating presents the taxonomic particle size class or substitute class based on Soil Taxonomy.

The system of soil classification used by the National Cooperative Soil Survey has six categories (Soil Survey Staff, 1999 and 2003). Beginning with the broadest, these categories are the order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family, and series. Classification is based on soil properties observed in the field or inferred from those observations or from laboratory measurements.  This table shows the family particle size class or substitute class of the soils in the survey area. 

The first part of the family name is the name of either a particle-size class or a substitute for a particle-size class. The term particle-size class is used to characterize the grain-size composition of the whole soil, including both the fine earth and the rock and pararock fragments up to the size of a pedon, but it excludes organic matter and salts more soluble than gypsum. Substitutes for particle-size classes are used for soils that have andic soil properties or a high content of volcanic glass, pumice, cinders, rock fragments, or gypsum. 

The categories are defined in the following paragraphs.

ORDER. Twelve soil orders are recognized. The differences among orders reflect the dominant soil-forming processes and the degree of soil formation. Each order is identified by a word ending in sol. An example is Alfisols.

SUBORDER. Each order is divided into suborders primarily on the basis of properties that influence soil genesis and are important to plant growth or properties that reflect the most important variables within the orders. The last syllable in the name of a suborder indicates the order. An example is Udalfs (Ud, meaning humid, plus alfs, from Alfisols).

GREAT GROUP. Each suborder is divided into great groups on the basis of close similarities in kind, arrangement, and degree of development of pedogenic horizons; soil moisture and temperature regimes; type of saturation; and base status. Each great group is identified by the name of a suborder and by a prefix that indicates a property of the soil. An example is Hapludalfs (Hapl, meaning minimal horizonation, plus udalfs, the suborder of the Alfisols that has a udic moisture regime).

SUBGROUP. Each great group has a typic subgroup. Other subgroups are intergrades or extragrades. The typic subgroup is the central concept of the great group; it is not necessarily the most extensive. Intergrades are transitions to other orders, suborders, or great groups. Extragrades have some properties that are not representative of the great group but do not indicate transitions to any other taxonomic class. Each subgroup is identified by one or more adjectives preceding the name of the great group. The adjective Typic identifies the subgroup that typifies the great group. An example is Typic Hapludalfs.

FAMILY. Families are established within a subgroup on the basis of physical and chemical properties and other characteristics that affect management. Generally, the properties are those of horizons below plow depth where there is much biological activity. Among the properties and characteristics considered are particle-size class, mineralogy class, cation-exchange activity class, soil temperature regime, soil depth, and reaction class. A family name consists of the name of a subgroup preceded by terms that indicate soil properties. An example is fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.

SERIES. The series consists of soils within a family that have horizons similar in color, texture, structure, reaction, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the profile.

It is determined for soils that have pH of less than 5.5. Soils having a low cation-exchange capacity (CEC) hold fewer cations and may require more frequent applications of fertilizer than soils having a high cation-exchange capacity. The ability to retain cations reduces the hazard of ground-water pollution. Effective CEC is a measure of CEC that is particularly useful in areas where the ion-exchange capacity of the soil is largely a result of variable charge components, such as allophane, kaolinite, hydrous iron and aluminum oxides, and organic matter, which result in a CEC that is not a fixed number but a function of pH.

Soils are assigned to one of four groups according to the rate of water infiltration when the soils are not protected by vegetation, are thoroughly wet, and receive precipitation from long-duration storms.

The soils in the United States are assigned to four groups (A, B, C, and D) and three dual classes (A/D, B/D, and C/D). The groups are defined as follows:

Group A. Soils having a high infiltration rate (low runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist mainly of deep, well drained to excessively drained sands or gravelly sands. These soils have a high rate of water transmission.

Group B. Soils having a moderate infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of moderately deep or deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that have moderately fine texture to moderately coarse texture. These soils have a moderate rate of water transmission.

Group C. Soils having a slow infiltration rate when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of soils having a layer that impedes the downward movement of water or soils of moderately fine texture or fine texture. These soils have a slow rate of water transmission.

Group D. Soils having a very slow infiltration rate (high runoff potential) when thoroughly wet. These consist chiefly of clays that have a high shrink-swell potential, soils that have a high water table, soils that have a claypan or clay layer at or near the surface, and soils that are shallow over nearly impervious material. These soils have a very slow rate of water transmission.

If a soil is assigned to a dual hydrologic group (A/D, B/D, or C/D), the first letter is for drained areas and the second is for undrained areas.

Conditions that increase the hazard of slippage but are not considered in this rating are undercutting lower portions or loading the upper parts of a slope or altering the drainage or offsite water contribution to the site, such as through irrigation.  

Slippage is an important consideration for engineering practices, such as constructing roads and buildings, and for forestry practices.

Soil slippage potential classes are estimated by observing slope; lithology, including contrasting lithologies; strike and dip; surface drainage patterns; and occurrences of such features as slip scars and slumps.

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.  

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site.

2746|"AASHTO Group Index"|"chorizon"|"aashind_r"|"Integer"|||"The AASHTO Group Index is a refinement to the seven major groups of the AASHTO soil classification system.  According to
this system, soil is classified into seven major groups: A -l through A-7. Soils classified into groups A-1, A-2. and A-3 are granular materials of which 35% or less of the particles pass through the No. 200 sieve. Soils of which more than 35% pass through the No. 200 sieve are classified into groups A-4, A-5, A-6, and A-7. These soils are mostly silt and clay-type materials.  

The classifications system is based on the following criteria:
1. Grain size
a. Gravel ; fraction passing the 75-mm( 3-in.) sieve and retained on the No. 10 (2-mm) U.S. sieve
b. sand: fraction passing the No. 10 (2-mm) U.S. sieve and retained on the No.200 (0.075-mm) U.S. sieve
c. Silt and clay: fraction passing the No. 200 U.S. sieve

2. Plasticity The term silty is applied when the fine fractions of the soil have a plasticity index of 10 or less. The term clayey is applied when the fine fractions have a plasticity index of 11 or more.
3. If cobbles and boulders (size larger than 75 mm) are encountered, they are excluded from the portion of the soil sample from which classification is made.

To evaluate the quality of a soil as a highway subgrade material, one must also incorporate a number called the group index (GI) with the groups and subgroups of the soil. This index is written in parentheses after the group or subgroup designation.
The group index is given by the equation:

GI = (F200-35)[0.2+ 0.005(LL- 40)] + 0.01(.F200-15)(PI- 10) 

where:
F200 = percentage passing through the No. 200 sieve
LL -- liquid limit
PI : plasticity index

The group index is used typically to refine an AASHTO class but in the soil survey database is often used as a standalone soil attribute.

For each soil layer, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component.

1)	Lithic Bedrock
2)	Paralithic Bedrock
3)	Densic Bedrock

Lithic bedrock and paralithic bedrock are comprised of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, which are coherent and consolidated into rock through pressure, heat, cementation, or fusion. Lithic bedrock represents the hardest type of bedrock, with a hardness of strongly coherent to indurated. Paralithic bedrock has a hardness of extremely weakly coherent to moderately coherent. It can occur as a thin layer of weathered bedrock above harder lithic bedrock. Paralithic bedrock can also be much thicker, extending well below the soil profile. 

Densic bedrock represents a unique kind of bedrock recognized within the soil survey. It is non-coherent and consolidated, dense root restrictive material, formed by pressure, heat, and dewatering of earth materials or sediments. Densic bedrock differs from densic materials, which formed under the compaction of glaciers, mudflows, and or human-caused compaction.

If more than one type of bedrock is described for an individual soil type, the depth to the shallowest one is given. If no bedrock is described in a map unit, it is represented by the ""greater than 200"" depth class.

Military category type 1 vehicles are lightweight and have low contact pressure (less than 2.0 pounds per square inch). For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during dry periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for a minimum number of vehicle passes (one) or a maximum of 50 vehicles in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.

The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site.

Military category type 3 vehicles are tractors with average contact pressures, tanks with comparatively low contact pressures, and some trailed vehicles with very low contact pressures. For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during wet periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for 50 vehicle passes in the same ruts. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for one vehicle pass. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.  An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit.  The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented.  

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit.  The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site."|||"Interpretation"|"MIL - Trafficability Veh.

Military category type 7 vehicles are rear-wheel-drive and other vehicles that generally are not expected to operate off road, especially on wet soils. For this interpretation, trafficability is the capacity of the soil to support these vehicles during wet periods. Trafficability estimates can be made from terrain data, such as topography data, and from data about soil and weather conditions. Military trafficability interpretations are based on procedures and criteria described in the Army Field Manual 5-430-00-1, chapter 7, and are conservative estimates for use in operations planning. Commanders and engineers must be cautious because the interpreted results can vary greatly.

Assessing the trafficability of fine grained soils (silts and clays) and sands that contain enough fine grained material to behave like fine grained soils when wet is more difficult than assessing the trafficability of coarse grained soils (clean sands). Soil-vehicle interactions involving soil strength, slipperiness, stickiness, large stones on the surface, and slope are the basis for trafficability interpretations.

The information presented in this interpretation is limited to problems associated with soils. It does not include problems associated with natural or manmade obstacles (such as forests or ditches) or with vehicle characteristics (such as the maximum tilt or side angle at which a vehicle can climb without power stall or overturning). The interpretation is developed for temperate and tropical climates and for soils that have been subject to freeze-thaw cycles if they are not frozen at the time of vehicle use.

Trafficability performance was estimated for one vehicle pass. Slope, stoniness, depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, flooding, ponding, and the Unified soil classification are the main soil properties used in determining vehicular trafficability. For good trafficability, the surface of the soil should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under repeated traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence soil strength, slickness, and stickiness are the Unified soil classification and its relationship to soil moisture conditions and surface ponding, flooding, and stoniness. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating classes of ""excellent,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" and ""poor"" indicate the extent to which the soils are suitable for military vehicle traffic. ""Excellent"" indicates that the soil has no characteristics that limit trafficability and that very low maintenance can be expected. ""Good"" indicates that the soil may have characteristics that limit trafficability but are favorable for use. Good operational performance and low maintenance can be expected. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. ""Fair"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that limit trafficability and are moderately favorable for use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or management. Fair performance, moderate maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected. ""Poor"" indicates that the soil has characteristics that severely limit trafficability and one or more features that are unfavorable for use. Generally, the limitations cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or special management. Poor performance, high maintenance, and soil degradation can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (0.01) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (1.00).

Helicopter landing zones are areas that are developed for landing helicopters that transport troops and supplies.

Ratings are based on the soil properties that influence construction, maintenance, and readiness of the landing zones. A dusty surface layer, slope, and the content of large stones influence the development and functionality of the landing zone. Flooding or ponding may restrict the period when the landing zone can be used.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect helicopter landing zones. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.

106|"Bivouac Areas"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"string"|254||"MIL - Military, Department of Defense

Bivouac areas are used intensively as field operation centers for military activity. They commonly require site preparation, such as shaping and leveling in areas used for tents and in parking areas, stabilizing roads and intensively used areas, and installing sanitary facilities and utility lines. Bivouac areas are subject to heavy foot traffic and some vehicular traffic.

This interpretation identifies those soil properties that influence the ease of developing bivouac areas and the performance of the areas after development. Soil properties that influence trafficability and promote the growth of vegetation after heavy use also are important. The limitations are less restrictive on sites for tents or remote camps.

Slope, stoniness, and depth to bedrock or a cemented pan are the main concerns in developing bivouac areas. For good trafficability, the surface of the bivouac area should absorb rainfall readily, should remain firm under heavy foot traffic, and should not be dusty when dry. Soil properties that influence trafficability are texture of the surface layer, wetness, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and large stones. The limitations of low Ksat and a clayey surface layer are not so severe in dry regions of the country as in other regions; however, silty soils may be more of a problem in the dry regions because they are dusty. Soil properties that influence the growth of plants are depth to bedrock or a cemented pan, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and the presence of toxic materials. Soils that are subject to flooding are particularly hazardous as bivouac areas because of the danger to life and property.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect bivouac areas. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Numerical ratings indicate the severity of individual limitations. The ratings are shown as decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

232|"Catastrophic Mortality, Large Animal Disposal, Pit"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"DHS - Department of Homeland Security

""Catastrophic mortality, large animal disposal, pit,"" is a method of disposing of animals that died from disease by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated trench. The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit. When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the filled pit area.  This interpretation is meant for instances where environmental isolation of pathogens is a primary concern.  The criteria are specifically developed to prevent groundwater contamination.

The interpretation is applicable to both heavily populated and sparsely populated areas. While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. The risk of contamination can be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of limiting soil properties. Ratings are for soils in their present condition. The present land use is not considered in the ratings.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet). However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water and to determine the design needed. These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources. The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata at or directly below the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential pollution of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations. Soils that are flooded or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate. Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit. It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits in which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour of the land.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final cover is based largely on soil texture and consistence, which determine workability when the soil is dry and when it is wet. Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses. The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that favors the growth of plants. It should not contain excess sodium or salts and should not be too acid. In comparison with other horizons, the surface layer in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter. Thus, it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

275|"Rubble and Debris Disposal, Large-Scale Event"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"DHS - Department of Homeland Security

Burial of rubble and debris in an expeditiously constructed landfill is a method of disposing of material that has been rendered unsafe and unusable by the effects of a large-scale disaster, either natural or man-made, often affecting tens of counties or parishes.  Many homes and business structures are rendered unfit for occupancy, either by destruction or contamination.  Such a landfill involves excavating a large pit or trench, placing the rubble and debris in the trench, and covering each layer with a blanket of soil material.  A final blanket of cover material is placed over the whole facility when completed.

This interpretation shows the degree and kind of limitations that affect a soil's use for such a landfill. The soil is evaluated from the surface to 79 inches.  An on-site investigation to greater depth will be needed for final site acceptance.  The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms; construction and maintenance of the site; and public health.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) or are shallow to bedrock, ice, a cemented pan, or stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the excavation.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing trenches for which the trench or pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the ground contour.

The ease with which the trench or pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil which affect the workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of rubble or debris.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a rubble and debris disposal operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled area. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical.  Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00.  They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses.  ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use.  Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system on these soils.  ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use.  The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.  ""Severely limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use.  The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures.  Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Composting is a method of using natural processes to change vegetative debris into a useful product. This interpretation shows the degree and kind of limitations that affect the siting of a subsurface composting facility to stabilize vegetative debris produced as a result of a major disaster.

2760|"Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Mortality, Incinerate"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"DHS - Department of Homeland Security

""Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Disposal, Incinerate"", is a method of disposing dead animals by placing the carcasses in a shallow excavated pit 91 cm (about 36 inches) deep or less. The carcasses are spread, compacted, and burned using established industry incineration techniques. Once carcasses have been sufficiently incinerated, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Soils are rated based on their limitation for burial of large animals following a catastrophic event. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and tornados. Limitations for burial of large animals during a catastrophic event are based primarily on contamination of groundwater, trafficability of excavation equipment, site selection, and site reclamation. 

While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential contamination of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of contamination of groundwater, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential contamination hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Burial operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.
Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Definitions of the ratings:
Not limited (rating index = 0) - The limitation for large animal incineration during a catastrophic event is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard excavation equipment, the soil has minimal contamination of groundwater, and soil reclamation using conventional processes is possible. Not limited soils have features that are very favorable for the specified use. Very good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system.

Slightly limited (rating index greater than 0 and less than 0.30) - The limitation for large animal incineration during a catastrophic event is slightly limited. There are one or more soil properties that pose a slight limitation for contamination of groundwater, site reclamation, or excavation equipment.  Slightly limited indicates the soil has features that are favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected.

Somewhat limited (greater than 0.30 and less than 0.80) - The limitation for large animal incineration during a catastrophic event is somewhat limited. There are more than one soil properties that pose a limitation for contamination of groundwater, site reclamation, or excavation equipment. Any corrective measures taken to overcome these limitations are considered economical however, special care must be taken to overcome limitations.  Somewhat limited indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.

Severely limited (greater than 0.80 and less than 0.99) - The limitation for large animal incineration during a catastrophic event is severely limited. There are many soil properties that pose a limitation for contamination of groundwater, site reclamation, or excavation equipment. Additionally, corrective measures will be needed to overcome these limitations. Corrective measures taken may be costly to overcome limitations that pose a severely limited rating. Severely limited indicates that the soil has features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation however, it is costly to do so. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

""Catastrophic Event, Large Animal Mortality, Burial"", is a method of disposing of deceased animals as a result of a large scale natural disaster such as a hurricane.  The animals are disposed of by placing the carcasses in successive layers in an excavated and sloped pit.  The carcasses are spread, compacted, and covered daily with a thin layer of soil that is excavated from the pit.  When the pit is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick is placed over the burial pit.

Soils are rated based on their limitation for burial of large animals following a catastrophic event. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, and tornados. Limitations for burial of large animals during a catastrophic event are based primarily on contamination of groundwater, trafficability of excavation equipment, site selection, and site reclamation. 

While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected.  Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater.  Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property.  The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Ratings are based on properties and qualities to the depth normally observed during soil mapping (approximately 6 or 7 feet).  However, because pits may be as deep as 15 feet or more, geologic investigations are needed to determine the potential for pollution of ground water as well as to determine the design needed.  These investigations, which are generally arranged by the pit developer, include the examination of stratification, rock formations, and geologic conditions that might lead to the conducting of leachates to aquifers, wells, watercourses, and other water sources.  The presence of hard, nonrippable bedrock, bedrock crevices, or highly permeable strata in or immediately underlying the proposed pit bottom is undesirable because of the difficulty in excavation and the potential contamination of underground water.

Properties that influence the risk of contamination of groundwater, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations.  Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential contamination hazard and are difficult to excavate.  Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the pit.  It may also cause difficulty in constructing pits for which the pit bottom must be kept level and oriented to follow the contour.

The ease with which the pit is dug and with which a soil can be used as daily and final covers is based largely on texture and consistence of the soil.  The texture and consistence of a soil determine the degree of workability of the soil both when dry and when wet.  Soils that are plastic and sticky when wet are difficult to excavate, grade, or compact and difficult to place as a uniformly thick cover over a layer of carcasses.  The uppermost part of the final cover should be soil material that is favorable for the growth of plants.  It should not contain excess sodium or salt and should not be too acid.  In comparison with other horizons, the A horizon in most soils has the best workability and the highest content of organic matter.  Thus, for a Large Animal Disposal, Burial operation it may be desirable to stockpile the surface layer for use in the final blanketing of the filled pit area.
Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).


The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. 

Not limited (rating index equals 0) - The limitation for large animal disposal during a catastrophic event is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard excavation equipment, the soil has minimal contamination of groundwater, and soil reclamation using conventional processes is possible. Not limited soils have features that are very favorable for the specified use. Very good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system.

Slightly limited (rating index greater than 0 but less than 0.30) - The limitation for large animal disposal during a catastrophic event is slightly limited. There are one or more soil properties that pose a slight limitation for contamination of groundwater, site reclamation, or excavation equipment.  Slightly limited indicates the soil have features that are favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Good performance and low maintenance can be expected.

Somewhat limited (greater than 0.30 but less than 0.80) - The limitation for large animal disposal during a catastrophic event is somewhat limited. There are more than one soil properties that pose a limitation for contamination of groundwater, site reclamation, or excavation equipment. Any corrective measures taken to overcome these limitations are considered economical however, special care must be taken to overcome limitations.  Somewhat limited indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected.
Severely limited (greater than 0.80 but less than 0.99) - The limitation for large animal disposal during a catastrophic event is severely limited. There are many soil properties that pose a limitation for contamination of groundwater, site reclamation, or excavation equipment. Additionally, corrective measures will be needed to overcome these limitations. Corrective measures taken may be costly to overcome limitations that pose a severely limited rating. Severely limited indicates that the soil has features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation however, it is costly to do so. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Very severely limited (rating index equals 1.0) - The limitation for large animal disposal during a catastrophic event is severely limited. There are one or more soil properties that pose a very severe limitation for contamination of groundwater, site reclamation, or excavation equipment. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Very poor performance and very high maintenance can be expected.

""Emergency Animal Mortality Disposal by Shallow Burial"" is a method of disposing of depopulated animals as a result of a large-scale natural disaster. Catastrophic events include, but are not limited to, hurricanes, wildfires, flooding, supply chain disruptions, and tornados. This disposal method employs a shallow trench, about 2 feet deep and wide enough to accommodate the mortalities. The trench is first lined with 6 to 12 inches of carbonaceous material, such as corn stalks or wood chips. The animals are then placed in a single layer in the excavation. When the trench is full, a final cover of soil material at least 2 feet thick, extending above grade, is placed over the burial pit and vegetation is established. Soils are rated based on their limitation for burial of large animals following a catastrophic event. Limitations for burial of large animals after or during a catastrophic event are based primarily on contamination of ground water, trafficability of excavation equipment, site selection, and site reclamation. 

While some general observations may be made, onsite evaluation is required before the final site is selected. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. Potential contamination may be reduced or eliminated by installing systems designed to overcome or reduce the effects of the limiting soil property. The rating is for soils in their present condition and does not consider present land use.

Verbal ratings are defined as follows:

Emergency Land Application of Milk

Disruptions in the supply chain and other problems can necessitate the emergency land disposal of milk.  Land application is a viable method of disposal as the constituents of milk can be beneficial as soil amendments. The characteristics of the soil are important in the application since favorable soil properties are required to prevent environmental damage.

Soils can be a non-member, partial member, or complete members of the set of soils that are limited for ""Emergency Land Application of Milk"".  If a soil property within 150 cm (60 inches) of the soil surface has a membership index greater than zero, then that soil property is limiting, and the soil restrictive feature is identified.  The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum membership indices of each soil interpretive property that comprise the ""Emergency Land Application of Milk"" interpretive rule.  Minor restrictive soil features are identified but not considered as part of the overall rating process.  These restrictive features could be important factors where the major restrictive features are overcome through design application.

Soil properties and qualities considered are those that affect liquid movement into and through the soil, the ability of the soil to attenuate material, the slope of the land surface, the presence of rock fragments, and the volume of soil available for absorbing the milk solids. Soil properties that affect absorption are permeability, the depth to a seasonal high water table, and the depth to bedrock or a cemented pan.   Stones and the depth to a seasonal high water table can interfere with the application of milk. 
 
Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest negative impact on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00).

Definitions of the ratings:

Not limited (rating index equals 0) - The limitation for land disposal of milk during a catastrophic event is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard application equipment, the soil has minimal risk of allowing groundwater contamination, and surface water contamination risk is low.

Slightly limited (rating index greater than 0 but less than 0.33) - The limitation for land disposal of milk during a catastrophic event is slightly limited. There are one or more soil properties that pose a slight limitation for contamination of groundwater, surface runoff, or application equipment.

Somewhat limited (greater than 0.33 but less than 0.67) - The limitation for land disposal of milk during a catastrophic event is somewhat limited. There are more than one soil properties that pose a limitation for contamination of groundwater, surface runoff, or application equipment. Any corrective measures taken to overcome these limitations are considered economical however, special care must be taken to overcome limitations.  Somewhat limited indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. 

Moderately limited (greater than 0.80 but less than 0.99) - The limitation for land disposal of milk during a catastrophic event is moderately limited. There are some soil properties that pose a limitation for contamination of groundwater, surface runoff, or application equipment limitations. Additionally, corrective measures will be needed to overcome these limitations. Corrective measures taken may be costly to overcome limitations that pose a severely limited rating. Moderately limited indicates that the soil has features that are unfavorable for the specified use. 

Very limited (rating index equals 1.0) - The limitation for land disposal of milk during a catastrophic event is severe. There are one or more soil properties that pose a very severe limitation for contamination of groundwater, surface runoff, or application equipment limitations. The limitations generally cannot be overcome. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all the soil features that affect these uses. 

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen.

2647|"Soil Health - Organic Matter"|"chorizon"|"om_r"|"Float"||2|"Organic matter percent is the weight of decomposed plant, animal, and microbial residues exclusive of non-decomposed plant and animal residues. It is expressed as a percentage, by weight, of the soil material that is less than 2 mm in diameter.

Significance:
Soil organic matter (SOM) influences the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils far more than suggested by its relatively small proportion in most soils. The organic fraction influences plant growth through its influence on these soil properties. It encourages soil aggregation, especially macroaggregation, increases porosity, and lowers bulk density. Because the soil structure is improved, water infiltration rates increase. SOM has a high capacity to adsorb and exchange cations and is important to pesticide binding. It furnishes energy to microorganisms in the soil. As SOM is decomposed by soil microbes, it releases nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, and many micronutrients, which become available for plant growth. SOM is a heterogeneous, dynamic substance that varies in particle size, carbon content, decomposition rate, and turnover time. In general, the content of SOM is highest at the surfacewhere plant, animal, and microbial residue inputs are greatestand decreases with depth. 

Total organic carbon (TOC) is the carbon (C) stored in SOM. Total organic carbon is also referred to as soil organic carbon (SOC) in the scientific literature. Organic carbon enters the soil through the decomposition of plant and animal residues, root exudates, and living and dead microorganisms. Inorganic carbon is common in calcareous soils in the form of calcium and magnesium carbonates. In calcareous soils, the content of inorganic carbon can exceed TOC.

Factors Affecting Content of SOM and SOC:

Inherent factors - Soil texture, parent material, drainage, climate, and time affect accumulation of SOM. Soils that are rich in clay have greater capacity to protect SOM from decomposition by stabilizing substances that bind to clay surfaces. The formation of soil aggregatesenabled by the presence of clay, aluminum and iron oxides, fungal hyphae, bacterial exudates (carbohydrates), and fine rootsprotects SOM from microbial decomposition. Extractable aluminum and allophanes, which are present in volcanic soils, can react with SOM to form compounds that are stable and resist microbial decomposition. Warm temperatures increase decomposition rates of SOM. High mean annual precipitation increases accumulation rates of SOM by stimulating the production of plant biomass. 

Loss of SOM through erosion results in SOM variations along slope gradients. Areas of level topography tend to have much more SOM than areas with other slope classes. Both elevation and topographic gradients affect local climate, vegetation distribution, and soil properties. They also affect associated biogeochemical processes, including SOM dynamics. Analysis of factors affecting C in the conterminous United States indicates that the effects of land use, topography (elevation and slope), and mean annual precipitation on SOM are more obvious than the effects of mean annual temperature. However, when other variables are highly restricted, SOM content clearly declines with increasing temperature.

Dynamic factors - Dynamic gains and losses in SOM are due primarily to management decisions in combination with climate and microbial influences. Accumulation of SOM is controlled by the rate of C mineralization, the amount and stage of decomposition of plant residues, and the addition of organic amendments to soil.

Soil organic carbon comprises approximately 52 to 58% of the SOM and is the main source of energy for soil microorganisms. The C within plant residues, particulate organic matter, and soil microbial biomass is generally considered to be within the active pool of SOM. The emergent view of SOM focuses on microbial access to SOM and includes an emphasis on the need to manage C flows rather than discrete C pools. During decomposition of SOM, energy and nutrients are released and utilized by plant roots and soil biota. Recognizing that SOM is a continuum of decomposition products is a first step in designing management strategies for renewing SOM sources throughout the year.

Soil aggregates of various sizes and stabilities can act as sites at which SOM is physically protected from decomposition and C mineralization. Soil disturbance and aggregate destruction increase biodegradation of SOM. Aggregates are readily broken apart by tillage operations.

Crop residues incorporated into or left on the soil surface reduce erosion and the losses of SOM associated with sediment. In acidic soils, applications of lime increase plant productivity, microbial activity, organic matter decomposition, and CO2 release.

The diversity of the soil microbial population affects SOM. For example, while soil bacteria and some fungi participate in SOM loss by mineralizing C compounds, other fungi, such as mycorrhizae, facilitate stabilization and physical protection by aggregating SOM with clay and minerals. SOM is better protected from degradation within aggregates than in free-form. 

Relationship to Soil Function:
SOM is one of the most important soil constituents. It affects plant growth by improving aggregate stability, soil structure, water availability, and nutrient cycling. SOM fractions in the active pool, described above, are the main source of energy and nutrients for soil microorganisms, which mediate nutrient cycling in the soil. Biochemically stable SOM participates in aggregate stability and in holding capacity for nutrients and water.

Microaggregates are formed by mineral interactions with iron and aluminum oxides and are generally considered an inherent soil characteristic. They are, however, impacted by current and past management. Fine roots, fungal hyphae, and organic carbon compounds, such as complex sugars (carbohydrates) and proteins (also referred to as glues), bind mineral particles and microaggregates together to form macroaggregates that are still porous enough to allow air, water, and plant roots to move through the soil.

An increase in SOM leads to greater biological diversity and activity in the soil, thus increasing biological control of plant diseases and pests.

Problems Associated with Low Organic Matter Levels:
Low levels of SOM result in energy-source shortages and thereby lowered levels of microbial biomass, activity, and nutrient mineralization. In noncalcareous soils, aggregate stability, infiltration, drainage, and airflow are also reduced. Scarcity of SOM results in less diversity in soil biota and a risk of disruption to the food chain equilibrium. This disruption can cause disturbance in the soil environment (e.g., increased plant pests and diseases and accumulation of toxic substances).

Improving SOM Levels:
An estimated 4.4x10 to the 9th power tons of C have been lost from soils of the United States due to traditional farming practices. Most of this carbon was SOC. Nearly half of the SOM has been lost from many agricultural soils. Other farming practices, such as no-till and cover cropping (especially when used together), can stop losses of SOM and even lead to increases. Continuous application of manure and compost can increase SOM. Burning, harvesting, or otherwise removing plant residues decreases SOM.

Measurement:
SOM is measured in the laboratory by determining total carbon (TC) content using either dry or wet-dry combustion. Current analytical methods do not distinguish between decomposed and nondecomposed residues, so soil is first sieved to 2 mm to remove as much of the recognizable plant material as possible. If no carbonates are present, TC is considered to be the same as TOC (or SOC). For calcareous soils, soil inorganic carbon in the form carbonates must also be measured and then subtracted from the TC to determine TOC content. Results are given as the percent TOC in dry soil. To convert percent TOC to percent SOM, multiply the TOC percentage by 1.724. To convert percent SOM to percent TOC, divide the SOM percentage by 1.724. Note that this value continues to be debated by researchers with possible values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 (Pribyl, 2010). A conversion factor of 2 has been suggested for this database but has not yet been adopted. Detailed procedures for measurement of SOM are outlined in 'Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 42, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual, Version 5.0,' (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

Many soil testing laboratories use a 'loss on ignition' method to estimate soil organic matter. The estimate produced by this method must be correlated to analytical TOC measurements for each area to improve accuracy. The loss on ignition method can provide a good indication of the trend in SOM content within a field. It is important to note that temperature and timing used for the loss on ignition approach vary across labs and can influence results. Thus, comparisons should be made using only results from within a given lab.

Currently, no standard method exists to measure TOC in the field. Attempts have been made to develop charts that match color to TOC content, but the correlation is better within soil landscapes and only for limited soils. Near-infrared spectroscopy has been tested for measuring C directly in the field, but it is expensive and sensitive to moisture content.

Estimates:
Color and feel are soil characteristics that can be used to estimate SOM content. Color comparisons in areas of similar parent materials and textures can be correlated with laboratory data and thereby enable a soil scientist to make field estimates. In general, darker colors or black indicate the presence of higher amounts of organic matter. The contrast of color between the A horizon and subsurface horizons is also a good indicator. Sandy soils tend to look darker with a lower content of SOM. In general, lower numbers for hue, value, and chroma (in the Munsell soil color system) tend to be associated with darker soil colors that are attributed to higher content of SOM, soil moisture, or both.

For each soil layer, this attribute is actually recorded as three separate values in the database. A low value and a high value indicate the range of this attribute for the soil component. A 'representative' value indicates the expected value of this attribute for the component. For this soil property, only the representative value is used.

2755|"Soil Health - Available Water Capacity"|"chorizon"|"awc_r"|"Float"||2|"Available water capacity (AWC) refers to the quantity of water that the soil is capable of storing for use by plants. It is expressed in centimeters of water per centimeter of soil for each soil layer.

Significance:
Available water capacity is an indicator of a soils ability to retain water and make it sufficiently available for plant use. In areas where daily rainfall is insufficient to meet plant needs, the capacity of soil to store water is very important (USDA-NRCS, 2008). Water held in the soil is needed to sustain plants between rainfall or irrigation events and provide a buffer against periods of water deficit. The capacity varies, depending on soil properties that affect retention of water. The most important properties are the content of organic matter, soil texture, bulk density, and soil structure, with corrections for salinity and rock fragments. Available water capacity determinations are used to develop water budgets, predict droughtiness, design and operate irrigation systems, design drainage systems, protect water resources, and predict yields (Lowery et al., 1996). They also are an important factor in the choice of plants or crops to be grown. The available water capacity can be increased by applying soil management that maximizes the soils inherent capacity to store water. Improving soil structure and ameliorating compacted zones can improve both the storage capacity of the soil itself and increase the depth to which plant roots can penetrate.

Factors Affecting Available Water Capacity:

Inherent factors.Available water capacity is affected by soil texture, amount of rock fragments, and a soils depth and layers. It is primarily controlled by soil texture and structure. Soils with higher silt contents generally have higher available water capacities, while sandy soils have the lowest available water capacities.  Rock fragments reduce a soils available water capacity proportionate to their volume, unless the rocks are porous. Soil depth and root-restricting layers affect the total available water capacity since they can limit the volume of soil available for root growth. 

Dynamic factors.Available water capacity is affected by soil organic matter, compaction, and salt concentrations. Organic matter can increase a soils capacity to store water, on average, equivalent to its weight in available water (Libohova et al., 2018). Indirectly, organic matter improves soil structure and aggregate stability, resulting in increased pore size and volume. These soil improvements result in increased infiltration and movement of water through the soil. Greater amounts of water entering the soil can then be used by plant roots. Compaction reduces the available water capacity by reducing the total pore volume. Soils with high salt concentrations have a reduced available water capacity. Solutes in soil water attract water (osmotic potential), making it difficult for plant roots to extract or uptake the water.

Measurement:
Available water capacity is determined in the lab by measuring the water content at field capacity (33 kPa) and wilting point (1500 kPa) and calculating the difference (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). Pressure plates or membranes are used to bring the soil sample to a desired matric potential (33 kPa or 1500 kPa). When at equilibrium, the soil sample is removed and dried to determine its water content.

2756|"Soil Health - Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)"|"chorizon"|"sar_r"|"Float"||1|"The sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is a measure of the amount of sodium (Na) relative to calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in the water extract from a saturated soil paste. It is the ratio of the Na concentration divided by the square root of one-half of the Ca + Mg concentration. It is a diagnostic parameter for the sodicity hazard of a soil. 

Significance: 
When SAR is greater than 13, the soil is considered a sodic soil. Sodic soils have excessive levels of sodium (Na) adsorbed on the cation-exchange sites of clays. In other words, they have a high exchangeable sodium percentage. In addition, these soils are low in total salts. The sodium causes the soil particles to repel each other and, as a result, the soil disperses. This process prevents the formation of soil aggregates and degrades soil structure. The dispersed physical condition results in poor water infiltration, the formation of surface crusts, and the restriction of water and air movement through soil, and it restricts seedling emergence and root growth. Also, there is increased dispersion of organic matter. Soil management on sodic soils should aim to preserve or increase soil organic matter in the surface soil, which increases infiltration and water movement through the soil (Diaz and Presley, 2017). Maintaining good drainage and low ground-water levels is important. In the reclamation process of sodic soils, the excessive sodium is replaced by calcium supplements before the leaching process begins (NDSU, 2018).

Factors Affecting Sodium Adsorption Ratio:

Inherent factors.Sodium or salts in the soils may originate from various natural sources, such as in-situ weathering of minerals and rocks (both terrestrial and marine origin), contributions from groundwater, deposition of materials containing sodium, and deposition or intrusion of sea water (Zia-ur-Rehaman et al., 2017). Atmospheric sources involve aeolian transport of salts, incorporation of marine salts into water vapor, and then inland precipitation (Chartres, 1993). Following this, the sodium either accumulates in the soil or is removed from the soil, depending on environmental conditions. If rainfall is insufficient to leach naturally occurring salts, they will accumulate in the soil.

Dynamic factors.Soils may become sodic or the sodic condition may worsen as a result of land use, including the use of irrigation water with elevated levels of sodium. Use of surface or ground water containing dissolved salts for irrigation adds salts to the soils. Irrigating from salt-impacted wells or saline industrial water may lead to the formation of saline soils (Sonon et al., 2015).

Measurement:
The saturated paste method (Soil Survey Staff, 2014) is used to measure SAR. It provides the best representative measurement of total soluble salts in the soil solution under field conditions. The saturated soil paste is prepared in the lab, an aqueous extract is obtained from the paste, and the salt cations are determined from the extract.

2757|"Soil Health - Soil Reaction (pH)"|"chorizon"|"ph1to1h2o_r"|"Float"||1|"Soil reaction (pH) is a measure of acidity or alkalinity. Chemically, it is a measurement of the hydrogen ion activity [H+] in the soil solution. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14; a pH of 7 is considered neutral. If pH values are greater than 7, the solution is considered basic or alkaline; if they are below 7, the solution is acidic. 

Significance:
The acidity or alkalinity of a soil affects the availability of plant nutrients, the activity of microorganisms, and the solubility of soil minerals (Brady, 1990). In general, pH values between 6 and 7.5 are optimum for general crop growth. Site-specific interpretations for soil health will depend on specific land uses and crop tolerances. In acid soils, calcium and magnesium, nitrate-nitrogen, phosphorus, boron, and molybdenum are deficient but aluminum and manganese are abundant, in some cases at levels toxic to some plants (USDA-NRCS, 2008). Phosphorus, iron, copper, zinc, and boron are frequently deficient in very alkaline soils. Bacterial populations and activity decline at low pH levels, whereas fungi adapt to a large range of pH (acidic and alkaline). Nitrification and nitrogen fixation are also inhibited by low pH (USDA-NRCS, 2008). To increase pH, liming, adding organic residues rich in basic cations, and rotating crops to interrupt the acidifying effect of leguminous crops are effective. Applying ammonium-based fertilizers, urea, sulfur, or ferrous sulfate; irrigating with acidifying fertilizers; or using acidifying residues (acid moss, pine needles, sawdust) decrease soil pH (USDA-NRCS, 2008). 

Factors Affecting Soil Reaction:

Inherent factors.The natural soil pH reflects the combined effects of climate, vegetation, topography, parent material, and time. Temperature and rainfall are two major factors that control the intensity of leaching and soil mineral weathering. Acidity is generally associated with leached soils, and alkalinity is generally associated with soils in drier regions. In arid climates, soil weathering and leaching are less intense, cations accumulate, and the soil becomes neutral or alkaline. In soils where the pH is less than 5, aluminum becomes soluble and reacts with water to produce hydrogen ions. Sandy soils may acidify more easily compared to clay soils because they have a low buffering capacity and tend to leach more readily. Vegetation has an effect on soil pH through the type of organic matter that is added; certain types of vegetation are soil acidifying (USDA-NRCS, 2008). 

Dynamic factors.The conversion of uncultivated land into cropland can result in drastic pH changes after a few years. These changes are caused by the removal of cations by crops, the acceleration of leaching, the effect of fertilizers and amendments, and the variations in organic matter content and soil buffering capacity (USDA-NRCS, 2008). Inorganic amendments (lime and gypsum) and organic amendments rich in cations increase soil pH. Ammonium from organic matter mineralization (nitrification), ammonium-based fertilizers, and sulfur compounds lower the pH. High rates of water percolation and infiltration can increase the leaching of cations and accelerate soil acidification.

Measurement:
The pH reported here is measured using the 1:1 soil to water ratio method (Soil Survey Staff, 2014). A crushed soil sample is mixed with an equal amount of water, and the pH of the suspension is measured.

2758|"Soil Health - Surface Texture"|"chtexturegrp"|"texdesc"|"Narrative Text"|||"Soil texture, or how the soil looks and feels, is determined by the size and proportion of the particles (clay, silt, and sand) that make up the mineral fraction. There are 12 USDA textural classes (e.g., sandy loam, silty clay). 

Significance:
The textural class of a soil is its most fundamental inherent characteristic that changes little over time (van Es et al., 2016). Its role in soil health studies is to inform the interpretation of most of the soil health indicators. Numerous soil properties are influenced by texture, including drainage, water-holding capacity, water movement through soil, infiltration, susceptibility to erosion, organic matter content, cation-exchange capacity, pH buffering capacity, and aeration. Soil texture also influences soil fertility, root growth, and plant vigor.

Factors Affecting Soil Surface Texture:

Inherent factors.—The nature and composition of the soil parent material greatly influences the particle-size distribution, or texture. Weathering of rocks and soil materials also affect the soil texture. Clays typically form over long periods of time through gradual chemical weathering. Freeze-thaw action can break apart rocks and gradually reduce the particle size of soil materials over time. Translocation of soil particles (e.g., clay) within the profile and between layers can alter the soil texture. Additions of particles by wind or water also affect the soil texture.

Dynamic factors.—Soil texture is altered little by management practices if the soil remains in place. Accelerated erosion by wind or water can remove the topsoil, exposing a subsoil with a different texture. Deposition of eroded materials can alter the texture of the surface soil. Deposition can be natural or anthropogenic (due to human activity). Land leveling and alteration (e.g., terracing) can change the soil texture.

Measurement:
The feel method is a crude method by which one can broadly judge the classes of soil texture. The lab methods involve removal of organic matter from a soil sample, the dispersion of the soil sample into single particles, and then the separation of sand through sieving. Clay is determined through sedimentation based on Stoke’s law. The full procedure is described in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

2759|"Soil Health - Bulk Density, One-Third Bar"|"chorizon"|"dbthirdbar_r"|"Float"||2|"Bulk density, one-third bar is the oven-dry weight of the soil material less than 2 millimeters in size per unit volume of soil at a water tension of 1/3 bar (33 kPa). It indicates the density of the soil and is expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) of soil material. 

Significance:
Bulk density is one of several soil properties frequently used as a measure of soil health (Volchko et al., 2014) and as an indicator of soil compaction and root restriction. It reflects the soils capacity to provide structural support, water and solute movement, and soil aeration (Arshad et al., 1996). Even though bulk density varies with soil texture, it is a dynamic soil property that also varies depending on the structural condition of the soil. It can be altered by cultivation, trampling by animals, compaction by agricultural machinery, and raindrop impact (Arshad et al., 1996). Any soil management that alters the soil cover, the amount of organic matter, soil structure, or porosity will affect soil bulk density (USDA-NRCS, 2008). A dense soil will restrict root growth and seedling emergence, reduce the available water capacity, restrict water and air movement, and ultimately reduce productivity. Management that improves soil bulk density includes reducing soil disturbance when the soil is wet, applying conservation practices that increase or maintain soil organic matter contents, and maintaining soil surface protection (such as a cover crop, especially a multi-species cover that can provide a wide range of root penetration).

Measurement of bulk density is essential for weight to volume or area conversions of other properties, such as soil carbon stocks and nutrient pools. It is also used in the calculation of pore space.

Factors Affecting Bulk Density:

Inherent factors.Bulk density is dependent on soil texture and the densities of soil mineral particles (sand, silt, and clay) and organic matter particles, as well as their packing arrangement. Generally, loose, porous soils and those rich in organic matter have lower bulk densities. Sandy soils have relatively high bulk densities since total pore space in sands is less than that of silty or clayey soils. Finer-textured soils that have good structure, such as silt loams and clay loams, have higher pore space and lower bulk density compared to sandy soils.

There is a general relationship of soil bulk density to root growth based on soil texture. Bulk densities ideal for root growth are less than 1.60 g/cc for sandy textures, less than 1.40 g/cc for loamy textures, and less than 1.10 g/cc for clayey textures. Bulk densities that restrict root growth are greater than 1.80 g/cc for sandy textures, 1.65 g/cc for loamy textures, and 1.47 g/cc for clayey textures.

Dynamic factors.Bulk density is changed by crop and land management practices that affect soil cover, organic matter, soil structure, and/or porosity. Cultivation can result in compacted soil layers with increased bulk density. Livestock as well as the use of agricultural and construction equipment can compact the soil and reduce porosity, especially on wet soils. Freeze-thaw action in the soil can lead to lowered bulk density.

Measurement:
In general, there are two broad groupings of bulk density methods. One group is for soil materials that are cohesive enough that a field sample can be removed, and the other group is for soils that are too fragile for field sampling and require an excavation operation. In methods for the former group, a clod sample is coated with a plastic film and the volume determined by submergence. There are also various core methods for the former group in which a cylinder of known volume is used to obtain a sample. The detailed procedures are outlined in the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory Methods Manual (Soil Survey Staff, 2014).

2682|"Fragile Soil Index"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Soils can be rated based on their susceptibility to degradation in the ""Fragile Soil Index"" interpretation.  Fragile soils are those that are most vulnerable to degradation. In other words, they can be easily degradedthey have a low resistance to degradation processes. They tend to be highly susceptible to erosion and can have a low capacity to recover after degradation has occurred (low resilience). Fragile soils are generally characterized by a low content of organic matter, low aggregate stability, and weak soil structure. They are generally located on sloping ground, have sparse plant cover, and tend to be in arid or semiarid regions. The index can be used for conservation and watershed planning to assist in identifying soils and areas highly vulnerable to degradation.

Depending on inherent soil characteristics and the climate, soils can vary from highly resistant, or stable, to vulnerable and extremely sensitive to degradation. Under stress, fragile soils can degrade to a new altered state, which may be less favorable or unfavorable for plant growth and less capable of performing soil functions. To assess the fragility of the soil, indicators of vulnerability to degradation processes are used. They include organic matter, soil structure, rooting depth, vegetative cover, slope, and aridity. 

The organic matter content indicates the capacity of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation processes. Organic matter improves the soil pore structure, increases water infiltration, and reduces soil compaction and soil erosion. Soil structure indicates the capacity of the soil to resist degradation from accelerated water erosion (by increasing the amount of infiltration). Pore structure is the most important aspect of soil structure as pores provide habitat for organism. Shallow soils are more vulnerable to degradation processes because they have limited rooting depth and have a reduced amount of material from which to form new soil. As erosion removes the upper soil profile, productivity will decline if the subsoil is limiting for crop growth. Vegetative cover is very important as uncovered soil is most vulnerable to the processes of soil erosion, both by wind and water. Slope (a measure of the steepness or the degree of inclination) indicates the degree of vulnerability to erosion and mass movement. Aridity is defined by the shortage of moisture. Lack of water is a main factor limiting biological processes and the ability of the soil to resist and/or recover from degradation.

Soils are placed into interpretive classes based on their index rating, which ranges from 0 to 1. An index rating of 1 is the most fragile, while a rating of zero is the least fragile. Interpretative classes are as follows:

Not Fragile (index rating less than or equal to 0.009)  These soils have a very high potential to resist degradation and be highly resilient. They are highly structured with an organic matter content greater than 5.7%, are nearly level, are deep or very deep, have greater than 85% vegetative cover, and are in a climate that is wet or very wet.

Slightly Fragile (index rating less than 0.009 and less than or equal to 0.209)  These soils have a high potential to resist degradation and be resilient. They are:
-- Poorly structured to weakly structured soils that have an extremely low to moderate content of organic matter, are very deep, have high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very shallow to moderately deep, have high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;
-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very deep, have low to moderately high vegetative cover, occur on nearly level ground, and are in wet or very wet climates;

-- Highly structured soils that have a very high content of organic matter, are very deep, have high vegetative cover; occur on nearly level ground, and in semi-dry to mildly wet climates; 

Moderately Fragile (index rating greater than 0.209 and less than or equal to 0.409)  These soils have a moderate potential to resist degradation and be moderately resilient. They are:

-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are deep, occur in nearly level to gently sloping areas, have high vegetative cover, and are in semi-dry climates; or 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are very shallow to very deep, occur in nearly level to strongly sloping areas, have high vegetative cover, and are in mildly wet climates.

Fragile (index rating greater than 0.409 and less than or equal to 0.609)  These soils have a low potential to resist degradation and low resilience. They are:
-- Well structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, are shallow to very deep, have moderate to moderately high vegetative cover, occur on steep slopes, and are in dry climates; 
-- Well structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, are shallow to very deep, have a low vegetative cover, occur in nearly level to gently sloping areas, and are in dry climates; 
-- Well structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, are deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on nearly level to very steep slopes, and are in a semi-dry climate; 
-- Moderately structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are deep, have moderately high vegetative cover, occur on moderately steep to very steep slopes, and are in semi-dry climates; or 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a low content of organic matter, occur on moderately steep to very steep slopes, have low vegetative cover, and are in wet or very wet climates.

Very Fragile (index rating greater than 0.609 and less than or equal to 0.809)  These soils have a very low potential to resist degradation and very low resilience. They are:
-- Weakly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on nearly level to very steep slopes, and are in dry climates; 
-- Weakly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are shallow to very deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on nearly level to very steep slopes, and are in very dry climates; or 
-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are very shallow, have no vegetative cover, occur on steep slopes, and are in mildly wet to wet climates.

Extremely Fragile (index rating greater than 0.809 and less than or equal to 1.0)  These soils can have no potential to resist degradation and no resilience. They are:
-- Poorly structured soils that have an extremely low content of organic matter, are very shallow, have low vegetative cover, occur on very steep slopes, and are in dry or very dry climates; 
-- Weakly structured soils that have a very low content of organic matter, are nearly level to very deep, have low vegetative cover, occur on very steep slopes, and are in dry climates; or
-- Very shallow soils on steep slopes.

2712|"Farm and Garden Composting Facility - Surface"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Composting is a method of using natural processes to change vegetative debris into a useful product. This interpretation evaluates the degree and kind of limitation(s) that affect the siting of a surface composting facility to stabilize vegetative debris produced as a result of typical farming and horticultural practices. 

The soil is evaluated from the surface to a depth of 79 inches. The ratings are based on the soil properties that affect trafficability; attenuation of suspended, soil solution, and gaseous decomposition products and microorganisms; construction and maintenance of the site; and public health. Improper site selection, design, or installation may cause contamination of ground water, seepage, and contamination of stream systems from surface drainage or floodwater. 

Properties that influence the risk of pollution, ease of excavation, trafficability, and revegetation are major considerations. Soils that flood or have a water table within the depth of excavation present a potential pollution hazard and are difficult to excavate. Soils that have high saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), that are shallow to bedrock, ice, or a cemented pan, or that have a high content of stones and boulders are limited because these features interfere with the installation, performance, and maintenance of the system. Slope is an important consideration because it affects the work involved in road construction, the performance of the roads, and the control of surface water around the facility.

Climatic factors influence the ease with which a composting facility can be maintained. Adequate precipitation to keep the mass moist, and sufficient heat to sustain biological activity are essential. 

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Numerical ratings indicate the severity of the individual limitations. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest limitation on the use (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature is not a limitation (0.00). 

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are limited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. ""Not limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the specified use. Good performance and very low maintenance can be expected of a properly designed and installed system on these soils. ""Somewhat limited"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for the specified use. The limitations can be overcome or minimized by special planning, design, or installation. Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for the specified use. The limitations generally cannot be overcome without major soil reclamation, special design, or expensive installation procedures. Poor performance and high maintenance can be expected.

Soil health is primarily influenced by human management, which is not captured in soil survey data at this time. These interpretations provide information on inherent soil properties that influence our ability to build healthy soils through management. 

A fertile and healthy soil is the basis for healthy plants, animals, and humans. Soil organic matter is the very foundation for healthy and productive soils. Understanding the role of organic matter in maintaining a healthy soil is essential for developing ecologically sound agricultural practices. Perhaps just as important is identifying areas at greater risk of organic matter depletion. For organic matter to accumulate in soil, the processes that synthesize organic matter generally need to be greater than the processes that destroy organic matter. These processes occur at continental and local scales. Continental-scale factors include the mean annual temperature, which ultimately governs the rates of biological processes, including both the synthesizing and destroying of organic matter. Another continental-scale factor is the amount of water generally available for use by plants and soil microbes. The amount of available water is governed by the amount of rainfall or snowmelt that an area receives in relation to evapotranspiration.  This interpretation does not take into account the application of irrigation water.

The continental-scale factors are modified by local factors. Oxygen is needed for both the accumulation and destruction of organic matter. It can be excluded from the soil by seasonal saturation, which generally favors the accumulation processes. The antecedent organic matter content is used as an indicator of the level of a soils vulnerability to loss of organic matter. In general, well aerated soils tend to have higher oxidation rates but may still accumulate organic matter, depending on other factors, such as ground cover, length of time that living roots are present in the soil, and management practices. Clay-sized particles in the soil help protect organic compounds and so tend to favor organic matter accumulation. The shape of the land surface also influences the organic matter content. Water and sediment tend to accumulate in concave areas while material tends to disperse in convex areas.  The degree of limitation caused by each of these properties is rated for a soil and the sum of the ratings is the overall rating.
 
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Numerical ratings indicate the propensity of the individual soil properties to influence organic matter degradation.  The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest ability to enable organic carbon depletion (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature becomes least likely to allow organic matter depletion (0.00). 

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils enable the depletion of organic matter. ""Organic matter depletion high""  indicates that the soil and site have features that are very conducive to the depletion of organic matter.  Very careful management will be needed to prevent serious organic matter loss when these soils are farmed.  ""Organic matter depletion moderately high"", ""Organic matter depletion moderate"", and ""Organic matter depletion moderately low"" are a gradient of the level of management needed to avoid organic matter depletion.  ""Organic matter depletion low"" indicates soils that have features that are favorable for organic matter accumulation. These soils allow more management options while still maintaining favorable organic matter levels.

Soil health is primarily influenced by human management, which is not captured in soil survey data at this time. These interpretations provide information on inherent soil properties that influence our ability to build healthy soils through management.
 
Organic soils used in agricultural production are subject to a loss of volume and depth of organic material due to oxidation caused by above normal microbial activity resulting from excessive water drainage, soil disturbance, or extended drought. Microbial mediated oxidation is the primary driver of volume reduction once excess water is removed.   Soil shrinkage and compaction due to dewatering is considered to be secondary. Any drawdown resulting in water levels below soil surface can result in increased subsidence rates.  The subsidence rate can also be influenced by agricultural practices. The type of tillage operation, such as plowing, disc harrowing and switch plowing, moldboard plowing increase the oxidation rate.  The use of no-till practice is recommended to slow the subsidence. Any aggressive tillage measure increases microbiological activity and decreases carbon sequestration.  Drainage water management can be implemented to control water tables to help slow the subsidence rate.

Several soil and site properties influence the rate of organic matter oxidation and subsidence.  Organic soils are generally found in cooler climates, thus, farmed organic soils in warmer climates are vulnerable.  Periodic saturation of the organic soil with water tends to decrease the rate of oxidation since anaerobic decomposition is slower than aerobic decomposition.  The pre-existing degree of decomposition is also a factor in the subsidence rate since as organic matter is decomposed, the remaining material becomes more resistant to decay.  Acidity in soils tends to slow microbial growth so acid soils are less prone to subsidence.  The degree to which each of the soil properties considered promotes oxidation is rated.  The average degree of accelerating microbial oxidation of organic matter is taken as the overall rating.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Numerical ratings indicate the suitability of the individual soil properties. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the most severe propensity for subsidence (1.00) and the point at which the soil has no propensity for subsidence, such as a mineral soil (0.00). 

Rating class terms indicate the rate at which the soils are likely to subside considering all the soil features that are examined for this rating. ""Severe subsidence"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the aerobic soil organisms that cause subsidence.  Very careful management will be needed to slow the subsidence rate.  ""Moderate subsidence"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for aerobic soil organisms. The soil can be made more sustainable by careful management.  ""Low subsidence"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for aerobic soil organisms.  With careful management the soil can be used for crop production and be nearly sustainable.  Soils that are not organic are rated ""Mineral soil"".  These soils do not subside due to organic matter oxidation.

Soil health is primarily influenced by human management, which is not captured in soil survey data at this time. These interpretations provide information on inherent soil properties that influence our ability to build healthy soils through management. 

Salts of sodium, calcium, potassium, and magnesium are produced by the weathering of minerals in soils.  Some salts can be added to the surface due to aeolian deposition.  Excess salts can be concentrated in soils when precipitation is sufficient to move salts within the soil but of insufficient quantity to move the salts out of the soil.  Salts move downward with percolating precipitation from the generally convex recharge areas of the landscape to the generally concave discharge areas.  Net water movement can be upward in these areas due to evapotranspiration or water movement may be more or less horizontal due to restrictive layers or differences in water transmission rates.  Excessive salt concentration in the surface of soil is detrimental to the germination and growth of crops due to the osmotic effects of the ions.  Several soil and site properties influence the movement and distribution of salts on the landscape.  Excess salts must exist in the soil in order to have movement and surface concentration.  The concentration of excess salts in soils is estimated by measuring the electrical conductivity of the soil.  The soil must exist in a non-leaching environment.  In areas where salt accumulates in the soil, precipitation does not exceed evapotranspiration, thus excess salts do not move vertically or laterally through the soil profile and then into ground or surface waters.  The soil surface and subsurface must generally concentrate water flow.  Research has shown that in regions where rainfall is limited the concave parts of the landscape also concentrate subsurface water flow as well as surface flow.  Salts move through soil when water flows.  Most water movement happens when the soil is saturated, thus, the depth to saturation and its temporal persistence influence whether or not salts will remain deep in the profile or be carried to the surface.  If the water table remains deep the salts will accumulate deeper in the profile.  If the water table is close enough to the surface that capillary rise and evapotranspiration can bring water to the soil surface, salts will accumulate at the surface.  The degree to which each of the soil properties considered promotes accumulation of surface salts is rated.  The rating of the attribute that contributes the least to surface salinization is taken as the overall rating.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Numerical ratings indicate the contributions of the individual soil properties. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil has the most severe propensity for surface salinization (1.00) and the point at which the soil has no propensity for surface salinization (0.00). 

Rating class terms indicate the rate at which the soils are likely to subside considering all the soil features that are examined for this rating. ""High surface salinization risk or already saline"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for the accumulation of salts at the surface or are already saline.  These soils are already limited by excess surface salts.  ""Surface salinization risk"" indicates that the soil has features that are somewhat favorable for surface salinization.  Careful management will be needed to avoid damage from salinity.  ""Low surface salinization risk"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for salinization.  These soils exist in climates where salinization does not occur or on landscape positions where salts are unlikely to accumulate.

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented. 

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site.

2763|"Soil Surface Sealing"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Soil health is primarily influenced by human management, which is not captured in soil survey data at this time. This interpretation provides information on inherent soil properties that influence our ability to build healthy soils through management.

Surface sealing is the orientation and packing of dispersed soil particles that result from the physical breakup of soil aggregates due to raindrop impact. Rapid soil wetting (in dry soils) and high exchangeable sodium percent can also cause aggregates to disperse. Sealing results when clay and silt particles get detached and/or dispersed and become suspended in the infiltrating water, which is moving downward through surface-connected pores. The pores become clogged with the fine particles, which become closely packed and create a surface seal.

Surface sealing is the initial process in the formation of a mineral crust, which is a broader term for a surface feature that is dense, hard, or restricts infiltration. A seal is a more specific term and refers to a surface layer that inhibits infiltration (Heil, 1993).

Significance:

The presence of a soil surface seal indicates poor soil health. Surface seals affect crop production by inhibiting seedling emergence, decreasing the infiltration rate, reducing the amount of available water to plants, and increasing runoff and erosion. They also diminish the natural recharge of aquifers (Assouline, 2011) and reduce aeration, and so affect several metabolic processes of micro and macro flora and fauna in the soil (Igwe and Udegbunam, 2008). Surface sealing has also been shown to be the primary cause of post-fire runoff and erosion (Larsen et al., 2007).

Factors Affecting Surface Sealing:

The intensity and energy of rainfall is an important factor affecting the susceptibility of a soil to form a seal (Moncada et al., 2014). Under most conditions and given enough time, most non-swelling bare soils will become impermeable to water because of clogging of surface pores (Heil, 1993). In swelling soils, the formation of surface seals occurs in the zone between the cracks (until the cracks close), thus limiting infiltration to the vicinity of the crack (Wells et al., 2003). 

Inherent factors.The tendency of a soil to form a seal depends on the stability of aggregates. Soils that are highly susceptible to surface sealing have low organic matter contents, are high in silt relative to clay and organic matter, and/or have weak aggregation where a high percentage of the clay disperses easily in water. Dispersion can also result from a high content of exchangeable sodium. Organic matter or Fe and Al oxides are important agents in the formation of stable aggregates. When the number of these agents is low, soils are more susceptible to aggregate breakup and surface sealing.

Dynamic factors.Management that protects the soil from raindrop impact and minimizes soil disturbance helps prevent surface sealing. Plant and mulch cover can shield the soil from raindrop impact and so reduce sealing in otherwise susceptible soils. Soil management practices that increase organic matter combined with the use of plant or residue cover for protection help prevent the formation of surface seals in most soils. Because tillage disrupts soil structure and aggregates, it accelerates the formation of seals. Management that minimizes soil disturbances and protects the soil from raindrop impact greatly increases infiltration and reduces runoff.

Interpretation Summary:

This interpretation is applicable to conditions or times when the soil surface, or any portion of it, is exposed to the impact of raindrops and there is significant rain or sprinkler irrigation. Soil surfaces that are void of vegetative, canopy, residue, litter, or duff cover are the most vulnerable to surface sealing.

Soils are rated based on the collective susceptibility of their properties to surface sealing. Ratings are on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0. If a soil's property within the surface layer has an index value greater than 0.0, then that soil property is limiting and contributes to the soils susceptibility to surface sealing. The overall interpretive rating assigned is the maximum index value for one or more of the soil interpretive properties that comprise the Soil Surface Sealing interpretation. These properties include exchangeable sodium, a silt/crusting index, water dispersible clay, and organic matter. Soils are placed into interpretive rating classes per their rating indices. These classes are low susceptibility (rating index = 0), moderate susceptibility (rating index greater than 0 and less than 1), and high susceptibility (rating index = 1).

2764|"Soil Susceptibility to Compaction"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Soils are rated based on their susceptibility to compaction from the operation of ground-based equipment for planting, harvesting, and site preparation activities when soils are moist.  Soil compaction is the process in which soil particles are pressed together more closely that in the original state.  Typically, the soil must be moist to be compacted because the mineral grains must slide together.  Compaction reduces the abundance mostly of large pores in the soil by damaging the structure of the soil.  This produces several effects that are unwanted in agricultural soils since large pores are most effective at transmitting water and air through the soil.  Compaction also increases the soil strength which can limit root penetration and growth.  The ability of soil to hold water is adversely affected by compaction since the large pores hold water.  The degree of compaction of a soil is measured by its bulk density, which is the mass per unit volume, generally expressed in grams per cubic centimeter.

Compacted soils are less favorable for good plant growth because of high soil bulk density and hardness, reduced pore space, and poor aeration and drainage. Root penetration and growth is decreased in compacted soils because the hardness or strength of these soils prevents the expansion of roots. Supplies of air, water, and nutrients that roots need are also less favorable when compaction decreases soil porosity and drainage.

Interpretation ratings are based on soil properties in the upper 12 inches of the profile.  Factors considered are soil texture, soil organic matter content, soil structure, rock fragment content, and the existing bulk density.  Each of these is thought to contribute to resisting the susceptibility of a soil to compaction when present.  Organic matter in the soil provides resistance to compaction and the resilience to ameliorate the effects with time.  Soil structure adds strength as discrete aggregates and it is the aggregates that are deformed or destroyed by compactive forces, thus strong soil structure lowers the susceptibility to compaction.  Similarly, rock fragments in the soil can bridge and provide a framework to resist compaction.  Finally, if a soil is already fairly dense causing further compaction is more difficult. 

Definitions of the ratings:

Low - The potential for compaction is insignificant.  This soil is able to support standard equipment with minimal compaction. The soil is moisture insensitive, exhibiting only small changes in density with changing moisture content.

Medium - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings may be reduced following compaction.  After the initial compaction (i.e., the first equipment pass), this soil is able to support standard equipment with only minimal increases in soil density.  The soil is intermediate between moisture insensitive and moisture sensitive.

High - The potential for compaction is significant.  The growth rate of seedlings will be reduced following compaction.  After initial compaction, this soil is still able to support standard equipment, but will continue to compact with each subsequent pass.  The soil is moisture sensitive, exhibiting large changes in density with changing moisture content.

2835|"Dynamic Soil Properties Response to Biochar"|"cointerp"|"interphrc"|"String"|254||"Dynamic Soil Properties Response to Biochar Application

Biochar is the solid byproduct of the decomposition of organic materials in oxygen-limited environments at high temperatures, a process known as known as pyrolysis. The extremely carbon-rich material has an average half-life of 1,400 years, due to its recalcitrant benzene-ring structure, allowing it to sequester carbon in soils over long periods of time, with the potential to provide substantial increases to soil organic matter when applied to soils. Although it has only recently begun to receive attention as a soil health amendment, biochar has been used to increase the fertility, productivity, and health of soils around the world by indigenous communities for thousands of years, most notably in the Amazon rainforest.
 
The feedstock used to produce biochar has a significant impact on its properties. Many waste products can be pyrolized to produce biochar.  These include forestry wastes, grass clippings, manure, food wastes, and many other waste products.  This interpretation assumes a corn stover and manure waste feedstock, producing a mid-range particle size, ideally sourced locally. In recent years, the number of large-scale biochar producers has increased, lowering the cost of using the material.  This interpretation assumes a minimal incorporation with tillage, rather spreading the biochar with a manure surface spreader.   Application methods vary.  The biochar can be mixed with manure and spread as a part of a slurry.

Soil and site properties can be dynamic (changeable on a human timescale) or more or less use invariant.  Dynamic soil properties associated with soil health include pH, cation exchange capacity, water holding capacity, bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, and organic matter content.  These properties affect aggregate stability, fungal growth, and microbial activity, which in turn affect plant growth.  Conceptually, these properties may be improved by the application of biochar.  The degree of improvement of a property is dependent upon how poor the current soil health condition is. Less healthy soils are more likely to be improved than healthy soils.  Thus, soils that are already healthy will not be substantively improved with biochar application. Some conditions of the site, such as slope, ponding, flooding, karst, and rock fragment content, while affecting the application and use of biochar, cannot be changed by biochar application.

The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are suited by all of the soil features that affect these uses. Numerical ratings indicate the degree of suitability of each soil or site feature. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest theoretical positive response of dynamic soil properties to biochar application (1.00) and the point at which the soil and site features indicate that biochar application will not improve dynamic soil properties (0.00).

Verbal ratings are defined as follows: 

Excellent response (rating index equals 1.0)  One or more dynamic soil properties present are suboptimal for the growth of crops and may be substantially improved with biochar application.  

Good response (rating index is greater than 0.75 but less than 1.0)  One or more dynamic soil properties present are suboptimal for the growth of crops and may be substantially improved with biochar application.  One or more use invariant properties may limit the effectiveness of biochar.

Fair response (rating index is greater than 0.25 but less than 0.75)  One or more dynamic soil properties present may already be nearly optimal for the growth of crops and may not be substantially improved with biochar application.  One or more use invariant properties may limit the effectiveness of biochar.

Low response (rating index is greater than 0 but less than 0.25).  One or more dynamic soil properties present may already be nearly optimal for the growth of crops and may not be substantially improved with biochar application.  One or more use invariant properties may limit the effectiveness of biochar, but not preclude its use.

Unsuited (rating index equals 0).  The soil is rendered unsuitable for biochar application because the use invariant soil and site properties are limiting to crop production and cannot be overcome. The site may be too steeply sloping, too wet, flooded, or ponded.

Soil health is primarily influenced by human management, which is not captured in soil survey data at this time. These interpretations provide information on inherent soil properties that influence our ability to build healthy soils through management.
 
Soil is the habitat for a wide variety of organisms, ranging from microscopic viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protozoa to micro- and meso-fauna including nematodes, mites, and springtails to macrofauna such as earthworms, centipedes and beetles to name just a few.  A healthy soil is a living system that supports an abundant and diverse biological community that aids crop production by providing key services and functions. These include: 1) the decomposition of organic materials and conversion into soil organic matter; 2) enhanced nutrient cycling; 3) improved soil structure and stability that positively influences water flow, storage and availability; 4) plant protection against disease, pests, and environmental stress; and, 5) detoxification of pollutants. Soil microbes are generally most abundant in the surface layer around plant roots (termed the rhizosphere).  Soils vary in their inherent ability to foster plant growth and thus also in their ability to support microbial populations.  Although bacteria and archaea possess alternative metabolic strategies to survive under low or no oxygen content (i.e., anaerobic conditions), all other soil organisms require oxygen and the majority of soil bacteria in agricultural soils function more efficiently in aerobic conditions. therefore, only aerobic organisms are considered. 

Several site and soil properties contribute to major attributes in the suitability for aerobic organisms. Those chosen for this table include: 
	Soil temperature, since most biological processes increase, often double, with a 10C increase in temperature; 
	water, inferred through the average total yearly precipitation since plant productivity is linked to precipitation and soil microbes thrive in the rhizosphere; 
	soil organic matter content as organic carbon is required by many soil organisms as an energy and carbon source;  
	soil pore space influences water and gas movement as well as physical space for organisms to occupy and the tortuosity of paths through which they may move;  
	soil water content is important as when too much water is present anaerobic processes begin and shifts the population to anaerobic bacteria and when too little is present organisms may die or go dormant; and,  
	osmotic conditions are also important, as are the presence of toxic materials or the absence of required elements.  .  The degree of favorability of each of these properties is rated for a soil and the degree of limitation of the least favorable attribute determines the overall rating.
 
The ratings are both verbal and numerical. Numerical ratings indicate the suitability of the individual soil properties. The ratings are shown in decimal fractions ranging from 0.01 to 1.00. They indicate gradations between the point at which a soil feature has the greatest favorability for organisms (1.00) and the point at which the soil feature becomes not favorable (0.00). 

Rating class terms indicate the extent to which the soils are favorable considering all the soil features that are examined for this land use. ""Very favorable"" indicates that the soil has features that are very favorable for aerobic soil organisms.  Healthy and thriving populations can be expected on properly managed agricultural systems on these soils. ""Somewhat favorable"" indicates that the soil has features that are moderately favorable for aerobic soil organisms. The soil can be made more favorable by careful management.  Fair performance and moderate maintenance can be expected. ""Very limited"" indicates that the soil has one or more features that are unfavorable for aerobic soil organisms.  

The map unit components listed for each map unit in the accompanying Summary by Map Unit table in Web Soil Survey or the Aggregation Report in Soil Data Viewer are determined by the aggregation method chosen. An aggregated rating class is shown for each map unit. The components listed for each map unit are only those that have the same rating class as listed for the map unit. The percent composition of each component in a particular map unit is presented to help the user better understand the percentage of each map unit that has the rating presented. 

Other components with different ratings may be present in each map unit. The ratings for all components, regardless of the map unit aggregated rating, can be viewed by generating the equivalent report from the Soil Reports tab in Web Soil Survey or from the Soil Data Mart site. Onsite investigation may be needed to validate these interpretations and to confirm the identity of the soil on a given site.

This interpretation is being provided for review and comment by the user community.  Please forward any feedback to the Soils Hotline soilshotline@lin.usda.gov.
